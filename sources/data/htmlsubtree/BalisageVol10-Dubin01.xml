               information interchange. Descriptively, they offer domain models. Prescriptively,
               they propose plans of action. While stipulative definitions fill in a model's representational
               gaps, elegance and descriptive power reduce the need for arbitrary choices in standards

         <div class="title e39">Annotations as Interpretations and Practices</div>
         <div class="para e40">There are usually two ways to look at the consensus
            represented by a data model or architecture: as the interpretation of
            a domain and as a plan of action. XML schemas, UML diagrams, SQL
            relational definitions, RDF vocabularies, and many other familiar tools
            can be read both as accounts of the entities and relational properties
            in a domain, and as guidelines for uniformity of naming and encoding.
            These two understandings are not necessarily at odds with each other:
            a specification may lay out both how its authors understand what
            they're modeling and how they have agreed to maintain consistency in
            expressing their data. But for purposes of promoting adoption,
            one often finds more relative emphasis on either the social power of
            uniform practice or on the generality of an elegant declarative
            account. We may rely on one of these more than the other because it's
            simply difficult to agree either on how we understand our domains or
            how we'll standardize our practices (let alone both).
            
         </div>
         <div class="para e41">For an example of where we might emphasize one modeling
            agenda over another, consider the application of encoding
            machine-readable annotations of digital resources. In an address to a
            humanities computing symposium at King's College, John Unsworth listed
            annotation among seven scholarly primitives, i.e., "basic functions
            common to scholarly activity across disciplines, over time, and
            independent of theoretical orientation" (
            <div class="xref e42" linkend="unsworth00"></div>). 
            Supporting digital annotation has long been a core use case in the 
            humanities, but the growing role of response and feedback in both 
            online social media and digital commerce has encouraged the 
            understanding of annotations as a resource genre in their own 
            right. A variety of architectures have consequently been
            adopted or proposed as bases for digital annotation, including HyTime
            (
            <div class="xref e43" linkend="calabretto97"></div>), the Multivalent Framework (
            <div class="xref e44" linkend="phelps97"></div>),  
            the Linguistic Annotation Framework
            (
            <div class="xref e45" linkend="LAF"></div>) and the Open Annotation Data 
            Model (
            <div class="xref e46" linkend="OA"></div>).
         </div>
         <div class="para e47">Open Annotation (OA) is an RDF vocabulary for relationships
            among resources, and for metadata about those relationships. OA is
            developed and published by a confluence of earlier projects now called
            the Open Annotation Community. The following OA serialization is taken from
            their cookbook of examples:

         <div class="para e53">In this example, the 
            <div class="emphasis e54">body</div> of the
            annotation is a web page describing the content of an image, the
            
            <div class="emphasis e55">target</div> of the annotation. In OA, an annotation
            body can be any resource that is somehow "about" another resource,
            i.e., that stands in some kind of annotating relation to the target.
            On the one hand, this is a descriptively general account of
            annotations as a class. But  on reflection, OA's generality seems to
            beg the question of what specific gap it fills in the RDF model of
            resource associations. If, according to OA, annotations are sets of
            related resources, what is it that distinguishes an annotation from
            any other RDF description? OA's answer would seem to be that
            annotations are exactly those descriptions serialized by the OA
            community employing the OA vocabulary. But instead of a common
            vocabulary, why not connect resources in a common architecture
            across diverse RDF applications? Suppose an annotation vocabulary were
            linked to specific annotating properties in local
            languagesâsomething like an  ISO 10744 enabling architecture.

            annotation, and resources linked by these annotating relations
            inferred to be targets and bodies via domain and range declarations

         <div class="para e72">This enabling architecture approach offers some advantages.
            Adopters of such a model would not have to convert their data to a
            different serialization, for example, and the question of what exactly can
            be annotated or serve as an annotation body could be governed by range
            and domain constraints on local subproperties (product reviews annotating
            products, footnotes annotating essays, etc.). Currently, OACG recommends
            the Dublin Core Types vocabulary for typing annotation targets and
            bodies, but the range of the 
            <div class="emphasis e73">hasTarget</div> and
            
            <div class="emphasis e74">hasBody</div> relations are purposefully undefined. As
            a result, nothing in the current OA specifications forbids
            interpretively challenging examples such as a person serving as the
            annotation body for a target integer or a geographic location as the
            body for a target person.
         </div>
         <div class="para e75">On the other hand, the descriptive approach has
            disadvantages as well. The OA community views 
            <div class="emphasis e76">annotations</div>
            as distinct from annotation 
            <div class="emphasis e77">bodies</div>, but still as individuals with
            properties of their own. Modeling annotations as relational instances
            would therefore seem to require reification of either RDF statements or named graphs
            (or the full existential quantification of first order
            logic) if annotations are to stand in relations as individuals. So the
            flexibility of using one's own vocabulary comes at the cost of
            complexity or a requirement for greater expressive power.

            contrasted in how particular regions of a resource are targeted for
            annotation. The OA Specifiers Module recommends particular addressing
            systems (including XPointer, W3C Media Fragments, etc.) and organizes
            them by type: fragment selectors, range selectors, and area selectors.
            But the OA specification does not make clear whether these three
            categories are exhaustive, or even whether the particular methods
            listed exhaust the categories (for example, whether there are area
            selectors in addition to the one listed for SVG files). 
            
            <div class="xref e81" linkend="oalist"></div> shows OA's provisional recommendation for
            combining selectors: they are arranged in an ordered list from most
            general to most specific. Caveats warn the reader that this chaining
            method may eventually be deprecated if the RDF community recommends a
            better approach to expressing order in graph structures

            selectors, while the first appeals to broader community decisions on
            how best to express ordered relations in RDF.

         <div class="title e103">Summary and Generalization: Data Model Roles</div>
         <div class="para e104">Data models and architectures play two kinds of role in
            information interchange. On the one hand they present a theory of how
            one should understand the domain of a specification or application,
            and on the other hand they offer a plan of action. One might call the
            former role a 
            <div class="emphasis e105">representational</div> agenda: the
            interest in doing justice to whatever it is that is being modeled. The
            second role we'll call a 
            <div class="emphasis e106">cohortative</div> agenda: 
            promoting uniformity of practice through stipulative definitions.
         </div>
         <div class="para e107">Successful data models need to address both the
            representational and cohortative agendas to some extent. Models by their
            nature are simplifications of reality, and never represent the
            richness of their domains with full fidelity. Developers adopting a
            specification must therefore accept its architecture with whatever
            limitations they find. On the other hand, data models must offer some
            semantic and expressive adequacyâthey won't be adopted if
            they're not inclusive enough for stakeholders' use cases or if they
            simply make no sense.
         </div>
         <div class="para e108">Just as stipulative definitions fill in a model's
            representational gaps, elegance and descriptive power reduce the need
            for arbitrary choices. As a result of this trade-off one sees two
            complementary costs in standards adoption: that of relinquishing
            full control over stipulations to a broader community vs. the complexity
            necessary for generality of scope and flexibility of application. But
            the language of information standards doesn't lay out this
            complementarity to their audience: RDF schemas and UML 
            diagrams don't announce the degree to which we should read them as
            micro-theories as opposed to operational definitions.
         </div>
         <div class="para e109">David Birnbaum presents a vivid illustration of these
            competing model agendas in his 1996 recommendations for Unicode
            encoding of early Cyrillic materials (
            <div class="xref e110" linkend="birnbaum96"></div>).
            Unicode organizes writing systems at the level of the script, rather
            than the language-specific alphabet or orthography, but specifies that
            characters convey distinctions in sound or meaning. As Birnbaum points
            out, orthographic systems that share the same script may assign
            different sounds or meanings to the same grapheme. The range of
            languages, regions, and time periods covered in Cyrillic materials
            scholarship therefore challenges Unicode's representational weakness
            in ways that typical business uses do not. But, as Birnbaum explains,
            although distinctions important to Slavic scholars may not always be
            straightforward to express in Unicode, the "academic and computational
            chaos and parochialism" that preceded Unicode's introduction lead to
            even more difficult text rendering and processing problems. Therefore
            Birnbaum's proposed encoding guidelines for Cyrillic texts address a
            range of problems for Slavic scholarship, while keeping Unicode's
            standardization and uniformity. This article is a rare example of
            making clear both the descriptive limitations of an architecture and
            the attraction of workarounds for leveraging the power of simply
            getting on board despite the problems.
         </div>
         <div class="para e111">Although the Open Annotation specifications don't lay out
            descriptive/prescriptive tensions as directly, details that may seem
            at first like semantic infelicities make more sense from a cohortative
            perspective. OA is primarily a set of encoding guidelines, not a
            theory of annotation. One adopts the Open Annotation Data Model for
            the value of participating in a collective enterprise, and reads the
            specification as a record of the working group's decisions. The
            promise of OA lies more in prospects for social success than in the
            model's descriptive power.
            
         </div>
         <div class="para e112">Standards development and adoption are social
            activitiesâeven formal aspects like data modeling. Decisions on
            which standards to adopt require that we weigh different kinds of
            costs against each other (e.g., complexity vs. stipulation costs).
            These decisions take place against a backdrop of social factors that
            usually aren't documented in standards or discussed in their
            supporting literature. But each conceptual framework, layered
            architecture or RDF schema we're offered has something to assert about
            how things are, and some plan to propose on how to proceed.
