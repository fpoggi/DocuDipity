                        This is somewhat complicated by the fact that the NISO standard versions of JATS
                        use a different version numbering scheme, and so should also be considered
                        separate flavors, even though they are really just newer versions of the existing

            include Archiving and Interchange (green), Journal Publishing (blue), and Article
            Authoring (pumpkin). They also come in three different formats: DTD, W3C Schema, and
            Relax NG.
            Most publishers who use the JATS choose to use the DTD format (

            Although they are still
            often referred to as the "NLM DTDs", this paper will use the terms "JATS" and "JATS
            schemas", to
            be clear that: A) the standard is now NISO, and is no longer specifically issued by
            the NLM; and B) it is not just DTDs, but also other schema formats.  One unfortunate
            aspect of
            the JATS acronym is that the tag suite is not limited to Journal Articles, but can
            be used for
            other types of documents (books, for example).

            JATSPack provides a well-defined way of packaging customizations and libraries associated
            with
            any of the JATS schema. JATSPacks are bundled packages of catalog files, schema,
            documentation, code, and sample files, all with a coherent purpose. The JATSPack format
            was
            primarily designed to facilitate the exchange and reuse of JATS customizations, but
            it could
            also be used to package and transfer code libraries — for example, XSLT transformations
            to
            translate JATS to/from some other format. JATSPack can be thought of as a format for
            
            plugin modules, with each
            plugin providing a bundle of new functionality which can be easily installed into
            an XML 
            toolset.

               to
               some customization of JATS that was not developed in-house. Very often, document instances,
               if they even have a document type declaration (doctype decl) at all, 
               do not include an absolute
               system identifier (a URI) to reference the DTD.  
               So, at a minimum, either an OASIS catalog entry must be
               added to a local catalog file to cross reference the formal public identifier 
               (FPI) to the DTD served somewhere on the Internet, or the DTD
               must be downloaded and installed on the local filesystem, and the XML processors be
               made
               aware of it. This is not especially difficult, but does require a certain level of
               expertise
               and coordination of system resources.

            <div class="para e87"> If the customization were packaged in the JATSPack format, then the
               necessary setup would be more automated. It would be as easy as identifying the desired
               pack and using the 
               <div class="code e88">jatspan</div> utility to install it in the local repository. 
               The 
               <div class="code e89">jatspan</div>
               utility automatically updates the local OASIS catalog file with a 
               <div class="code e90">&lt;nextCatalog&gt;</div>
               entry to
               point to the new JATSPack. So

               The important point here is that, because of the way the JATSPack format incorporates

               <div class="emphasis e102" role="ital">raison d'etre</div>
               for the EXPath Packaging specification.        
               The transformation languages in which these
               are usually written, XSLT, XQuery, and XProc, are mature enough that they can be written
               in
               a portable, system-independent way. 
               The JATSPack format is specified and JATSPAN provides many examples, which reduces
               the
               burden of making decisions about how exactly to package the bundle.
               JATSPAN provides a publically-accessible place to upload packages, so developers
               don't have to find places on their own websites for them.
               If a library were created as a JATSPack, and were put
               on JATSPAN, it would be easier for potential users to discover and install. 
               If this
               library had dependencies on others, then those others would not have to be bundled
               with
               this package. The
               
               <div class="code e103">jatspan</div> client program would take care of resolving these dependencies automatically.

            <div class="para e108">
               A publisher or a developer who is introduced to the JATS for the first time
               can be a bit overwhelmed.  To be sure, JATS is extremely well documented,
               as one can readily see by browsing the 
               
               <div xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" class="link e109" xlink:actuate="onRequest" xlink:href="http://dtd.nlm.nih.gov/" xlink:show="new" xlink:type="simple">NLM web site</div>.
               Yet the fact that JATS have been in use for a long time, and that there are
               now many different branches (flavors) and versions, can make them seem,
               to someone who is not familiar with them, complicated.
               
            </div>
            <div class="para e110">
               Someone who wants to evaluate the suitability of JATS for their particular
               needs might want to be able to quickly set up a system that can process
               any JATS instance document, regardless of what flavor or version that instance
               document conforms to.  This is difficult to do, because each flavor and each
               version of the JATS is distributed as a separate, flattened Zip file which 
               includes the bundled version of all of the files needed for that particular
               set.  For example, the 
               <div xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" class="link e111" xlink:actuate="onRequest" xlink:href="ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/pub/archive_dtd/books/2.3/book-dtd-2.3.zip" xlink:show="new" xlink:type="simple">books 
                  2.3 DTD Zip file
               </div> includes all of the
               books-specific modules, as well as all of the shared modules, and even
               the xhtml and mathml2 library modules.
               
            </div>
            <div class="para e112">
               For each flavor/version of interest, it is necessary to download and extract
               the Zip file, and then manually tweak the provided OASIS catalog file for 
               that set, and then point your XML tool set to use that catalog
               file.  
               Because there are so many different tag set bundles, it would be quite
               time-consuming to configure a system that is able to use them all.
               This is not seen as a problem, because this is not the primary 
               use-case that the NLM site is designed to serve.  
               They provide stand-alone bundles specifically so that a user who
               is interested in only, for example, Publishing 2.3, can download that version
               and not be confused by all of the others (Jeff Beck, personal communication,
               3/22/2011).

               understand and process any JATS instance document; either for the purposes
               of evaluating JATS, or so that they can exchange documents with other
               organizations, it would be quite difficult.

               </div> (hereinafter EXPath-pkg, written by Florent Georges).
               EXPath-pkg is a simple, concise format for the packaging of files of various core
               XML technologies, including XML Schema, Relax NG, Schematron, NVDL, XSLT, XQuery,
               and 
               XProc (
               <div class="xref e129" linkend="T"></div>).
               It also provides a flexible extension mechanism which is exploited by JATSPack to
               define
               additional file types, and other requirements specific to its needs. 
            </div>
            <div class="para e130"> As defined by EXPath-pkg, a package is a set of files that fulfill a common purpose.
               Each package has a globally unique name (which is a URI) and an abbreviated name (hereafter
               referred to as 
               <div class="emphasis e131" role="bital">abbrev</div>), an NCName. 
               
               <div class="emphasis e132" role="bital">Abbrev</div> values are case-insensitive, and, by convention,
               all lowercase. A component is one file within a package, and can be one of several
               different
               types. 
            </div>
            <div class="para e133"> A package includes a package descriptor (similar to a JAR manifest file) which lists
               the package contents and top-level metadata about the package. This metadata includes

               URI name, 
               <div class="emphasis e134" role="bital">abbrev</div>, version number, and a list of dependencies. 
               Finally, all the files of a
               package are arranged in a specified directory structure, and used to create a Zip
               file, which
               by convention is given a name based on the

               Calabash XProc processor. (Support in Saxon and Calabash is via third-party plugins.)

               The ODD has very clean structure, which encourages literate programming (documentation
               and code in the same source document), examples of usage, clear separation of concerns,
               and
               best of all, encapsulation of all the relevant data into a single document with a
               standardized structure (
               <div class="xref e165" linkend="I"></div>). 
               The JATSPack format strives to be similar to ODD, and could even be
               thought of as encapsulating the library or customization in one document, 
               if one expands the
               definition of "document" to include "Zip file" (which is quite reasonable).

               to help ensure that the abbreviated names will be unique, they are composed of
               two parts, each of which is an NCName (by convention, all lowercase, and the underscore
               
               character should not be used in either part).  
               These are separated by a forward slash in the package descriptor file, for example,
               "nlmjats/archiving".

                           might be controversial.
                           Because I moved files into a different directory structure,
                           but I wanted them to remain usable by systems without OASIS catalog files, 
                           using the relative system identifiers, I had to change these identifiers in the 
                           modules that reference the moved files. I also made other minor edits to reconcile
                           
                           cases where, for example, two different instances of a document were referred to by
                           
                           the same public identifier (FPI). I made these changes, 
                           without changing the FPIs, for those files that 
                           were changed. I think this is the right decision, for the following reason. The 
                           significance of an FPI is that any tool that resolves it correctly will get 
                           identical results. The FPI specifies a 
                           <div class="emphasis e231">logical resource</div> –- a
                           DTD or an external parsed entity — not a

                              sequence
                           </div>. With this change, the resolution of any given FPI will still 
                           result in the exact same entity replacement text,
                           when all of the sub-entities are correctly resolved.

               By itself, repackaging this library in this way could
               not be considered an improvement over the current deployment of this tool,
               as a Zip file.
               However, there are a few advantages. Since this package is on JATSPAN, it can be searched
               for and discovered on JATSPAN. The documentation can be browsed by anyone from the
               JATSPAN
               site, without downloading and extracting the package. Anyone using the 
               <div class="code e257">jatspan</div> client
               utility could install it automatically with the following simple command. 
               
               <div class="programlisting e258" xml:space="preserve">jatspan install html/publishing-3.0-preview</div>
               Anyone with an EXPath-pkg enabled system would have instant
               programmatic access to the XProc stylesheets and XSLT modules, through their import
               URIs.
               Normally this would require some integration effort, but with JATSPack, it is automatic.
               
               
            </div>
            <div class="para e259"> Furthermore, there are no disadvantages to packaging this way. The JATSPAN site allows
               anyone to download this package as a .zip file (exactly the same file as the .xar,
               but with
               a different extension), which can then be unzipped on the filesystem and used just
               as easily
               as before.

            <div class="para e260"> Another advantage is that other JATSPacks, written by other authors, could
               declare a dependency on this package.  This would simplify the installation and
               integration of those later packages.  And this point makes a good segue to the next
               example.

               basically
               the same steps as above. The

               In the JATSPack, those have been removed, and replaced with a
               dependency declaration in the package descriptor file.  The advantage of this is
               that users can avoid having two copies of the same library (the preview stylesheets)
               on their system at the same time.  In this simple example, it would not be
               a big problem.  But the problem of multiple copies of the same resources
               can get severe as the number of packages and libraries increases.

               I would
               have to download the Zip file, unpack it, and read the README file to see if there
               are any
               specific instructions I needed to worry about. Then I would find a place for it to
               reside on
               my filesystem and move the files there. The tricky bit is then to set up oXygen to
               understand the public identifer, and have it retrieve the correct DTD. I could either
               add an entry to my
               own personal catalog file (if I have one), add it to oXygen's master catalog file,
               or set up a "document type association" inside oXygen.

               oXygen to it.  But that is a one-time operation, which then allows me instant access
               to any number of JATSPacks.  Also, this one-time setup is 
               actually quite trivial, and easier than installing the support for the single TaxPub
               document type as described above.  The setup involves two steps:

         <div class="para e340"> The original motivation for developing 
            the JATSPack specification was to devise a means to package schema
            customizations together with software libraries that allow users to transform documents
            to and
            from the new schema. This is still, perhaps, the primary use-case. 
         </div>
         <div class="para e341"> There is an ongoing sea change in the way that scientific research is published and
            presented. The lines between traditional definitions of media types, such as journal
            articles,
            books, wikis, blog posts, presentations, etc., are continually getting blurred 
            (
            <div class="xref e342" linkend="G"></div>). This implies
            that the number of different types of content included with scientific publications
            is growing
            rapidly. Often it is most appropriate to include disparate types of data with the
            original
            source documents, and that means either customizing the JATS schema, or providing
            some other
            means of including it, such as (for example) using the flexible 
            
            <div xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" class="link e343" xlink:actuate="onRequest" xlink:href="http://jats.nlm.nih.gov/archiving/tag-library/0.4/n-6pe0.html" xlink:show="new" xlink:type="simple">

            </div>
            elements, and adding appropriate layer validation. 
         </div>
         <div class="para e345"> The TaxPub example illustrates that the JATSPack/JATSPAN infrastructure can facilitate
            interchange of documents and data between organizations. A common theme overheard
            at last
            year's JATS-Con was that often, individual publishers' versions of their JATS DTDs
            are not interchangeable. In other words, PMC's version of JATS is not the same as
            Highwire's, even if they nominally use the same flavor and version of the tag
            suite. With a small amount of up-front work to resolve discrepancies and repackage
            customizations, this interchange problem can be helped, if not solved. 
         </div>
         <div class="para e346"> The TaxPub example also serves to illustrate that the cost of doing compatible 
            customizations need not be high. This can lead to easier reuse of existing XML 
            vocabularies. The XML
            landscape is vast, and vocabularies have been defined for wide array of specialized
            
            topic domains — biological taxonomy is just one example. 
            As mentioned previously, and as TaxPub illustrates, often it is very
            appropriate and beneficial to mix markup from other vocabularies directly into 
            the instance documents. If the customization is deployed as a JATSPack, then one 
            could make the customization without having to worry quite so much about breaking
            compatibility with existing systems, and the ability to exchange documents. 
         </div>
         <div class="para e347"> But often one wants to do more with a document than just validate it, and that 
            is where the true power of EXPath-pkg, and by extension JATSPack, lies. 
            Customizations can also be packaged
            with software libraries in XProc, XQuery, and XSLT, that allow users to transform
            documents to
            and from the new schema. This would facilitate making forwards-compatible schema
            customizations. 
         </div>
         <div class="para e348">
            First, let's review what is meant by backwards and forwards compatibility, in the
            context of document schemas.  For this, I highly recommend  
            
            <div class="xref e349" linkend="M"></div>.  In a nutshell, backwards compatibility means that existing 
            (version A) documents can be used by new XML processing systems, and forwards 
            compatibility means that newer documents (version B) can be
            used by existing processing systems.
            
         </div>
         <div class="para e350"> A very successful model of forwards compatibility, that we are
            all familiar with, is the "must ignore" pattern of extensibility of HTML. 
            This stipulates that HTML renderers must ignore any tags that they don't understand.
            In
            effect, this is a forwards-compatibility extension substitution rule. It allows future
            designers to customize the HTML schema, adding elements and attributes, while being
            able to
            predict how document instances in the new schema will be processed by old systems.
            The "must
            ignore" rule is one substitution rule, but it is very limited. If designers could
            include a
            set of transformations with the new schema, then those designers could define their
            own
            substitution rules.

                           TaxPub, as an
                           extension, provides semantics beyond what is available in the base DTD through creating
                           newly named elements - thus lending itself to domain-specific application. However,
                           TaxPub

               plain-old-JATS. This would make it easier for third-party systems to install meaningful
               and
               useful support for TaxPub documents. Unlike the "must ignore" rule, the substitution
               rules

               broad. A customization does not necessarily include a new DTD (or Relax NG or XSD
               schema).
               Customizations are often implemented as the addition of layered validation implemented
               in, for example, Schematron, that imposes a set of style rules that are more specific
               to a
               particular organization's use of the JATS. Sometimes these validation rules are coded
               simply as XSLT stylesheets that are applied to instance documents, and return a predefined
               report format.

               these sorts of style checkers couldn't also be packaged as JATSPacks and made available
               to third parties. Since JATSPack/JATSPAN imposes rules on versioning and the uniqueness
               of identifiers, it can help to safeguard against incompatibilities that can result

               decentralized customizations is a bad thing, or should be prohibited (even
               if that were possible).
               Yet, an inherent problem is that
               they can be difficult to manage and control. 
               The JATSPAN infrastructure is designed to adapt to
               this decentralization, while at the same time providing specifications and imposing
               requirements, such that the proliferation of new schema doesn't become a problem.
               It does this by requiring that the formal public identifiers (FPIs) and URIs used
               to identify resources are 
               well defined and unique, and also by virtue of its fixed directory structure, ensuring

               However, there are two problems that must be overcome before Relax NG schemas

               The first is the lack of URI names for these
               Relax NG resources, and the second is that there is no standard way for documents
               to
               identify the Relax NG schema to which they conform.

            <div class="para e382">
               The first problem, the lack of URI names, is inherent in the current JATS 
               infrastructure.  Relax NG schema are identified by URIs,
               and not FPIs.  In other words, URIs are used as the names of 
               these resources, and there is no other name.  That this is a problem was 
               eloquently described by Norman Walsh in his blog post from 2004 titled,

               provided by the JATSPacks that come before it in the dependency tree. For example,

            To fully realize the possible benefits, much more work would
            be required.  However, I
            believe that establishing this specification and web site is a good step in the
            right direction.
            
         </div>
         <div class="para e530">
            One of the goals of this proposal is to help publishers and digital repositories 
            to produce XML systems that are more open.  Sharing of schema customizations and
            libraries would reduce the amount of duplicated
            effort that is expended when adapting systems to different XML document types.  
            In order to acheive this goal,
            this format will have to obtain some measure of support within the publishing
            community.  
            The challenge lies in persuading
            systems architects that this format would benefit them,
            so that they will expend the effort to adapt their systems to support it.
            By providing a "starter set" of JATSPacks, as described in the examples section,
            I hope that I've shown that:  A) creating JATSPacks is easy, and B) sharing JATSPacks
            will benefit everybody.
            
         </div>
         <div class="para e531">
            Of course, there is nothing inherently JATS-specific in the JATSPack format.  
            The ways in which JATSPack extends EXPath-pkg, as described
            
            <div xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" class="link e532" linkend="whence" xlink:actuate="onRequest" xlink:show="new" xlink:type="simple">above</div>, are primarily to add schema of various formats, 
            sample documents, documentation, and OASIS catalog files.  It would be nice if
            these extensions could be rolled into the EXPath-pkg specification itself.  That might
            eventually obviate the need for the JATSPAN website; it could be merged with CXAN.
            Whether that would help or hurt the cause of getting the format adopted is
            anybody's guess.
