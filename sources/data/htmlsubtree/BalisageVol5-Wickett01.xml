               the
               interoperability of the record.

         <div class="para e30">Although context clearly influences how markup structures are deployed and how they
            are
            retrieved and processed, the ways that context determines the interpretation of markup
            are not
            well-understood or consistently conceptualized. The role of context has been acknowledged
            in a
            few narrow areas -- for example, in how it determines the grammatical mood of the
            assertions
            signaled by tags and the ontological status of XML documents (
            <div class="xref e31" linkend="renear03"></div>).
            Context is an obvious part of markup systems, since processing any XML document requires
            the
            interplay of the document with structures and systems that are not part of the document.
            
         </div>
         <div class="para e32">A developed understanding of the role of context in markup can illuminate well-known
            problems for information systems, particularly those associated with interoperability.
            While
            there is a general sense that interoperability is a sort of freedom from local context,
            interoperability itself is not well-theorized in terms of markup structures and
            interpretation. Preservation and portability of markup structures may be aided by
            approaches
            that operate in reference to the logical meaning of those structures (
            <div class="xref e33" linkend="dubin03"></div>), but the reliance on the semantic meaning of structures presents a sort of boot-strapping
            challenge since these interpretations must be determined at some point. Context (both
            internal
            and external to a document) will play an essential role in mapping from syntax into
            semantics,
            so we need a clear understanding of how context shapes the assignment of meaning to
            markup
            structures.
         </div>
         <div class="para e34">Wrightson has demonstrated how situation semantics (
            <div class="xref e35" linkend="bp1983"></div>) can provide
            insights into the communication of information through markup structures (
            <div class="xref e36" linkend="wrightson01"></div>) and has presented a corresponding toolkit for the analysis of XML
            documents as utterances (
            <div class="xref e37" linkend="wrightson05"></div>). Applying situation semantics to
            markup is attractive since it is intended as a general account of communication and
            so holds
            the promise of integraing our understanding of markup meaning into a general theory
            of
            communication. 
         </div>
         <div class="para e38">That much markup seems to function at least in some respects like a natural language,
            rather than a formal language, makes the connection with theories of natural lanaguage
            particularly promsing. Situation semantics is used here to support an account of the
            assignment of meaning to markup structures; first through the definition of a particular
            kind
            of interoperability for markup structures and then in an examination of the role of
            schema in
            interoperability and interpretation.
         </div>
         <div class="para e39">Situation semantics supports a view of communication of information through markup
            structures that gives explicit accounting for the context in which the record was
            created and
            in which it is interpreted. In what follows situation semantics is used to define
            interoperability and to demonstrate how specific parts of Dublin Core OAI-PMH records
            convey
            contextual information that supports the interpretation of those records.

         <div class="title e41">Situation Semantics and XML Metadata</div>
         <div class="para e42">This section briefly introduces concepts from situation semantics and shows how they
            may
            be applied to XML metadata. 
         </div>
         <div class="para e43">Barwise and Perry apply situation semantics to the interpretation of natural language
            utterances (
            <div class="xref e44" linkend="bp1983"></div>) by modeling the meaning of an indicative sentence as a
            relation between a situation in which the sentence is uttered and a situation which
            is
            described by the utterance of the sentence. The position here is that since metadata
            records
            are sequences of indicative sentences, situation semantics can usefully explain the
            ways in
            which they carry meaning. An utterance situation is made up of a 
            <div class="emphasis e45" role="ital">discourse situation</div> and the speaker's 
            <div class="emphasis e46" role="ital">connections</div> (discussed in the following section). Any situation which uniquely
            anchors the roles of a speaker, an addressee, a discourse location, and an expression
            is
            considered a discourse situation. 
         </div>
         <div class="para e47"> The technical notion of a situation here is very close to our intuitive one: a situation
            occurs at a space-time location and involves individuals participating in certain
            roles and
            standing in relations. It also closely corresponds to the notion of a 
            <div class="emphasis e48" role="ital">state of affairs</div>, especially since situations are abstract objects that may or
            may not obtain. 
         </div>
         <div class="para e49">In the case of descriptive metadata the role of the speaker can be anchored to the
            metadata creator at the time when the record is created. 
            <div class="popupBox e50">
               <div class="popupLabel" onmouseover="$('#d1e94').show('1000');" onmouseout="$('#d1e94').hide('1000');">[ footnote ]</div>
               <div id="d1e94" style="display: none;">
                  <div class="footnote">
                     <div class="para e51"> This is a simplifying assumption, since metadata creation will generally involve
                        a
                        chain of communicating individuals and institutions. 
                     </div>
                  </div>
               </div>
            </div>In contrast, the role of the addressee is left open until the record is retrieved
            and viewed by some consumer, and it is only at this point that all of the roles are
            anchored
            to form a complete discourse situation. The entire discourse situation will be extended
            in
            time and typically mediated through several computational environments. This extension
            in time
            is a primary motivator for interoperability efforts that are concerned with supporting
            the
            preservation (especially in the long term) of metadata records.
         </div>
         <div class="para e52">Since descriptive metadata records are created without specification of the addressee,
            the
            speaker and the addressee may be operating in very distinct environments. This kind
            of
            disparity is common in written communication, where an author and a reader may be
            separated by
            centuries or differences of language. Regardless, the differences between the environment
            of a
            speaker and an addressee of XML documents requires our attention in order to understand
            the
            contribution that elements of those environments make to the interpretation of documents.
            
         </div>
         <div class="para e53">The described situation for a metadata record is one in which a resource with each
            of the
            properties given in the record exists. The space-time location for this described
            situation
            will temporally precede and overlap the space-time location of the situation in which
            the
            record was created, since presumably a resource exists before it is described.
            <div class="popupBox e54">
               <div class="popupLabel" onmouseover="$('#d1e102').show('1000');" onmouseout="$('#d1e102').hide('1000');">[ footnote ]</div>

                  </div>
               </div>
            </div> Hopefully the discourse situation that captures the communication of metadata will
            fall entirely within the described situation that arises from that metadata, and consumers
            are
            able to access the described resource. But one can easily imagine cases where the
            resource
            indicated by the metadata record no longer exists at the time of the retrieval of
            the record,
            or it no longer has the properties indicated in the record (e.g. it is no longer accessible
            through a given URL). It is also possible to imagine cases where the described situation
            does
            not obtain at all, since the record is simply erroneous. In any case, a record won't
            facilitate communication and access to resources unless an addressee is able to interpret
            it.
            To ensure the operation of records and to support access, we need to understand what
            goes into
            the interpretation of descriptive metadata records.

               from each

               is
               for the speaker's connections to match the connections of the addressee for each expression

               For
               example, the connections given in the XML declaration provide a setting that constrains
               how
               the record is to processed. We can further divide this expression and focus on the
               part that
               leads (the "?" that immediately follows the opening bracket), which gives a setting
               in which
               the rest of the tag can be recognized as containing processing information.

               also
               establish a setting that influences how the expressions that occur within it are
               interpreted. These schematic settings are secondary to the setting provided by the
               XML
               declaration since the context in which it is possible to process and use them is given

         <div class="title e68">Defining Descriptive Interoperability</div>
         <div class="para e69">While interoperability is frequently called upon as a motivating factor for improvement
            in
            information systems, it is not often given a systematic characterization within a
            general
            framework for description and communication. A working notion of interoperability
            for
            descriptive metadata in XML (inspired by (
            <div class="xref e70" linkend="sperberg00"></div>), (
            <div class="xref e71" linkend="renearetal02"></div>) and in line with the OAIS Reference Model (
            <div class="xref e72" linkend="lavoie04"></div>)) is that 
            <div class="emphasis e73" role="ital">an interoperable description is one that supports licensing
               the same set of assertions in any environment
            </div>.
         </div>
         <div class="para e74">In terms of situation semantics then, an interoperable description is one for which,
            given
            any addressee, the the set of connections that link expressions to their referents
            remains
            fixed. Interoperability then can be viewed as a kind of independence from particular
            features
            of the discourse situation. The time or location associated with the utterance of
            an
            interoperable description can vary without a change in the meaning of the utterance.
            In order
            to achieve this kind of interoperability, metadata creators must either convey these
            connections explicitly, or supply enough information to allow a user to discover the
            intended
            connections. Unless connections are given in (or pointed to by) a record, someone
            trying infer
            information from the document is left to determine connections on her own.
         </div>
         <div class="para e75">Of course, such a reader will not be entirely on her own. She can still use her background
            knowledge, and given a record that is human-readable, she might have a fair degree
            of success.
            But she would have to rely on a larger set of resource situations to establish connections
            for
            the expressions in the record than in a case where connections are explicitly given.
         </div>
         <div class="para e76">In fact, resource situations that supply the information necessary to process or interpret
            XML metadata will always be a requirement for determining the assertions licensed
            by a
            document. Grasping the intended connections for records requires a certain set of
            knowledge
            about the conventions in play, so it is unrealistic to expect a descriptive record
            to be fully
            interoperable as given above. This suggests an adjustment to the definition of
            interoperability, and characterizing it as an effort to reduce the burden of gaining
            access to
            the resource situations required to fully interpret a record.

            As discussed above, since this is an XML document, the primary setting for the record
            is given
            by the XML processing instruction. This expression indicates connections that establish
            how
            the document is to be processed or interpreted. A secondary setting can be identified
            by
            examining the attributes within the root "OAI-PMH" element for the record.
         </div>
         <div class="para e86">The schema location attribute within the "OAI-PMH" tag acts as a pointer to documentation
            that specifies a certain kind of connections for child elements that follow this element.
            These connections provide the vocabulary and structural constraints for tags and attributes,
            and they may be overridden by further schema declarations within a child element.
            In this
            case, while the OAI-PMH.xsd document does give instructions for the construction of
            valid
            OAI-PMH documents by giving structural and datatype restrictions, it does not give
            the full
            intended semantics for tags that conform to it. 
         </div>
         <div class="para e87">A third setting is given in this example by the namespace and schema attributes in
            the
            "oai_dc" element. As above, the schema location attribute points to documentation
            that
            specifies syntactic connections for the child elements. The connections given here
            override
            the those given in the OAI-PMH element. This means that the connections for "identifier"
            within the "oai_dc" element correspond to the Dublin Core Element Set, whereas the
            occurrences
            of "identifier" elements higher up in the record have the connections established
            by
            OAI-PMH.

         <div class="para e88">The oai_dc.xsd documentation imports simpledc20021212.xsd, and therefore does provide

            in the core element set for Dublin Core. Each of the element names that appear within
            the
            third setting are defined in this documentation through marked-up annotations. In
            contrast,
            OAI-PMH.xsd only gives syntactic information and processing instructions. The intended
            semantics for OAI element names such as "identifier", "record", or "metadata" are
            not provided
            in the documentation itself, nor is there any reference (network locatable or otherwise)
            to a
            source for definitions of these terms. These terms are defined in the protocol documentation,
            but it is not clear how an addressee (reader/consumer) of the record could reach that
            documentation without additional information or direction.

            <div class="para e91">An "identifier" element within a OAI-PMH record is specified by the documentation
               given
               in OAI-PMH.xsd as occurring within a "header" element and as containing a URI. However,
               there is no direct indication of what the given identifier serves to identify. A user
               of
               this record can rely on the nesting of the element within the "header" of the "record"
               element to infer that the identifier serves to identify the record. Or they could
               use their
               knowledge that the record contains metadata about a resource to infer that the identifier
               picks out a resource that has all of properties indicated within the "metadata"
               element.

            <div class="para e92">In fact, some services that convert OAI-PMH records in RDF take the second approach
               and
               use the OAI identifier as a subject URI for statements about a resource that are derived
               from the record. However, the OAI Protocol for Metadata Harvesting states that "the
               identifier described here is 
               <div class="emphasis e93" role="ital">not</div> that of a 
               <div class="emphasis e94" role="ital">resource</div>. The nature of a resource identifier is outside the scope

            <div class="para e96">This is a failure of interoperability. The RDF that result from this kind of
               transformation are intended to make statements about a resource, but they will actually
               be
               making erroneous statements about a metadata container. Thus the assertions licensed
               by
               markup in the environment of the addressee who has transformed the description will
               differ
               significantly from the assertions licensed in the environment of the speaker who issued
               the
               original record. The resource situation in use by the transformation was incomplete
               with
               respect to the connections for the OAI identifier, and an error resulted. The connections
               used in the generation of the OAI record did not match the connection used to transform
               the
               record into RDF. This kind of a failure of interoperability is common and well-known,
               and
               situation semantics provides a systematic framework in which to understand it.

            such an approach assumes an unambiguous mapping from tags to the logical predicates
            associated
            with those tags. The formal tag set description approach does not directly address
            how meaning

            when that

            the OAI identifier, the name of a tag alone does not always convey everything necessary
            to
            properly interpret the logical meaning of corresponding markup. The problems that
            arise for
            this kind of mis-interpretation become obvious when the markup is used to derive RDF
