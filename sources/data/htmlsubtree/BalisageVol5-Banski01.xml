            <div class="para e8">The present submission focuses on the concept of stand-off annotation as it is implemented
               in the current
               version of the TEI Guidelines. We look at the motivation for choosing the stand-off
               approach to encoding
               Language Resources, briefly recount the history of the concept within the broadly
               conceived TEI setting (since
               TEI P3 and the LT NSL suite, through CES and XCES, ending in TEI P5), review the various
               kinds of hyperlink
               semantics and identify three kinds of reasons for the poor uptake of the TEI-recommended
               stand-off annotation
               approach to corpus encoding. We also suggest some solutions that may contribute to
               a change in the current
               state of affairs.

                  </div>

               a statement of
               tendencies and pragmatic advantages: while the OHCO thesis does not hold in all cases,
               due to the existence of
               overlapping hierarchies and non-contiguous objects, it appears to constrain many conceptualizations
               of the
               nature of text, and OHCO-based approaches to e.g. text editing appear to have practical
               advantages. Much of
               linguistic modelling is also done assuming OHCO as the general conceptual approach,
               accompanied by additional
               devices (movement, linking, feature percolation, re-entrancy, etc.) as ways to more
               or less system(at)ically plug the holes
               that OHCO alone cannot fill.
            </div>
            <div class="para e92">Criticism of the OHCO thesis has appeared extensively in the literature – see e.g.
               
               <div class="xref e93" linkend="renearetal93"></div> for an early formulation of the problems and reformulations of the thesis, and 
               <div class="xref e94" linkend="derose04"></div> for an overview of ways in which non-OHCO structures can be represented, also within
               the
               TEI; the Extreme Markup Languages and Balisage series contain numerous articles devoted
               to this issue. Our
               purpose here is not to provide new flashy arguments for something that has already
               sprung extensive research on
               alternatives to XML and on ways to handle the failure of the OHCO thesis by devices
               native to XML. Our aim is
               practical: we point out that overlap and discontinuity, and the need to embrace rather
               than trick them, are
               inherent in both theoretical linguistic constructs and in corpus linguistic practice.
               We furthermore point out
               that the existence of mismatches in description is one of the arguments for a modular
               approach to linguistic
               modelling, whereby objects with sometimes strikingly different properties are supposed
               to constitute separate
               domains of study, which are linked by correspondence or mapping rules. This is what
               we mean by theoretical
               modularity. There is also a more practical aspect of modularity, where it is advisable
               to keep the output of
               various linguistic tools separated, especially where each of these separate outputs
               may constitute the base for
               further descriptions in a multi-layer system.
            </div>
            <div class="para e95">This state of affairs is not only due to the fact that different kinds of linguistic
               description require
               different and often conflicting segmentations at various levels, some examples of
               which we shall look at below.
               It is also due to the fact that there is no single way to demarcate the domain of
               any component of grammar –
               there are a multitude of syntactic, semantic, morphological, phonological, etc. theories
               with differing
               theoretical apparatus, and sometimes even with differing domains of application, although
               they are theories of
               seemingly the same phenomena. Consider the virtual non-existence of linguistic morphology
               in the days of the
               early Generative Grammar (from the late 50's throughout the 60's), when the syntagmatic
               aspect of word
               composition (ordering of morphs, the "atoms of word forms") was delegated to the syntactic
               component, and its
               paradigmatic aspect (allomorphy, i.e. modifications in the shape of morphs) was delegated
               to the ultra-powerful
               phonological component (cf. 
               <div class="xref e96" linkend="anderson92"></div>, ch. 2 for a concise discussion and references).
               Consider also the lack of interest of Classical Phonemics in morphophonological phenomena

               the two – vis-à-vis models based on so-called Cognitive Grammar, which introduce different
               divisions. The point
               is that there is no single unified approach to morphology, syntax or semantics, etc.,
               and any encoding strategy
               choosing one particular perspective as privileged is bound to attract criticism and
               to discourage researchers
               working in different paradigms. We OWLs can sometimes agree that what we want to describe
               is stretches of
               manifestations of natural language. Sometimes, this is also the limit of our consent,
               and anything beyond this,
               e.g. our views on the proper segmentation of these stretches, should be presented
               as equal variants rather than
               one "proper" version with possible "deviations".

               not want to subject them to any kind of non-OHCO mechanism apart from a simple disjunction
               between (sub)trees:
               we want a single document to provide us with both variant readings in the case of
               (b), and both syntactic words
               in the case of (c). Example (a), on the other hand, may be argued to show different
               perspectives, as defined
               from the point of view of the software tool that is used to tokenize and tag the resulting
               strings. In such

            <div class="para e211">It is one of the tenets of at least some sustainability-oriented encoding practices
               that the object of
               description (in our case, text) be maximally divorced from its possible theoretical
               views (annotations). This
               way, the text, kept in as neutral form as possible, remains an attractive resource,
               open to future analyses and
               to the creation of new views, i.e., new annotation layers (this goes under the heading
               of extensibility).
               Equally attractive are the annotations themselves – they can serve as the basis for
               comparison of tools and theories.
               Security (immutability) of the text itself is also essential, and this is what stand-off
               approaches strive to
               guarantee, because they are non-destructive with respect to the resource that gets
               annotated.

               annotations with the
               source text. This is very true of the current state of affairs. Our point is that
               if stand-off annotation can be
               handled by generic XML tools then the issue of the longevity of the annotation layers
               (note that the source text
               is relatively safe) piggybacks on the general well-being of XML technology, ages together
               with it, and is open to
               whatever plastic surgery is applied to make XML or its descendants look good 20 years
               from now.

               <div class="emphasis e226" role="ital">multiply-annotated text</div>, which also uses layers of annotation but each of these layers contains an
               exact copy of the source text, and thus achieves sustainability through redundancy,
               has more advantages than
               stand-off approaches that keep a single copy of the source text. It is not our aim
               to argue against that
               theoretical stance because, like the stand-off approach that we concentrate on here,
               it assumes modularity of
               description, and modularity is what OWLs need. Additionally, in principle, both approaches
               can be mixed in e.g.
               crowd-sourced corpora where annotation layers are contributed by external parties.
               Both approaches also appear
               to share one more problem: the lack of generic XML tool support, a matter which we
               will return to below.
            </div>
            <div class="para e227">Summing up, stand-off technology has both advantages and disadvantages from the point
               of view of the two
               deservedly hot leitmotifs of language documentation and linguistic infrastructure:
               sustainability and
               interoperability. On the one hand, the advocates of stand-off markup note the relative
               stability of source text
               with low-density markup (or with no markup at all), as well as the putative flexibility
               of the annotation
               layers. On the other hand, those who concentrate on the holistic advantages of language
               resources note that the
               merger of the source with the annotation layers requires dedicated machinery. In the
               next section, we look at
               three stand-off TEI systems that attempt to cope with these issues in various ways.

               affect the given directory,

               corpus, including
               definitions of various taxonomies, which are referenced from the local headers. An
               early version of TEI ODD

               point, and tailored it to
               their specific purposes and the context in which they are deployed. The first of them
               is the Open-Content Text
               Corpus. This is a resource meant to be both the open-source testing ground for TEI
               stand-off applications and
               at the same time, to constitute a common platform for collective research and academic
               work on preserving and
               describing language resources, especially those for "lower-density languages". While
               we leave the details aside
               (see 
               <div class="xref e262" linkend="bansp-beataw10"></div>), we note that the multilingual nature of the corpus (at the time of
               writing, it contains mini-subcorpora for 55 languages) forces the introduction of
               one more layer of
               organization, with its own header. Thus, each text of the OCTC includes three headers,
               the links to which have
               been mercifully omitted from the diagram below. Because the corpus is meant as a platform
               for many possible
               research or student teams, it is explicitly modelled as a 
               <div class="emphasis e263" role="bold">multi-instance</div>
               stand-off structure, which means that it is expected that a single annotation layer
               of the OCTC may come in
               many variants, depending on the tools used to create it. This is indicated below.

               Examination Corpus), a learner corpus containing examination essays by students of
               the University of Warsaw.
               Its primary aims are to study the transfer of linguistic structures of Polish onto
               the second language and to
               measure the inter-rater agreement in order to attain greater objectivity in grading
               language exams (see 
               <div class="xref e275" linkend="banski-gozdawa10"></div> for details). The electronic source texts are produced by transcribers (the exams
               are
               written in hand), who fill out templates already divided into sentence-sized chunks,
               and introduce extra markup
               for unclear passages, special textual features, gaps and the like. The source text
               is then tokenized according
               to an agreed tokenization standard (by default, according to whitespace and punctuation,
               but the English part
               additionally obeys the CLAWS tokenization rules), and each token is indexed. This
               becomes the new base that
               other annotation layers reference, and in effect, the original source text remains
               only as a backup. This
               system is close to what 
               <div class="xref e276" linkend="cummings09"></div> describes; to distinguish it from systems in which the

            <div class="title e291">2.4. Motivation for stand-off representation: summary</div>
            <div class="para e292">This section looked at the motivation for the use of stand-off annotation in linguistic
               applications. We
               first looked at the application of the OHCO thesis to linguistic theorizing and found
               that there was no
               straightforward relationship between cases where OHCO failed and the preferred encoding
               strategy. The choice
               appears to depend on the particular perspective (hinted at rather than defined here
               with reference to
               linguistics): whether OHCO-conforming or not, perspectives that reflect the modular
               nature of the grammar, or
               that are due to practical issues such as the choice of the particular tagging tool
               or tagging system, call for
               dedicated annotation documents. In systems such as the FLEC, the practical issues
               reach even further and depend
               on the human annotators of each kind of documents (the essays are planned to be always
               transcribed as soon as
               possible, to provide raw material for studies of the lexical content).
            </div>
            <div class="para e293">Let us reiterate: many of the above issues could be encoded within single files, thanks
               to the ingenuity of
               the many designs allowing for non-OHCO representations. But we OWLs are not even going
               to try them: we want our
               encoding layers separated, for reasons both theoretical (they encode different pieces
               of our descriptions and we
               want to keep it that way) and practical (we want relatively generic systems that "just
               work" without requiring
               dedicated tools; if they require too much hassle, we'll just grab a different, existing
               solution, and not
               necessarily one based on XML).

         <div class="title e295">3. Stand-off annotation: the semantics of hyperlinks</div>
         <div class="para e296">To our knowledge, the earliest mentions of stand-off annotation, at least in the broad
            context of the TEI,
            were made in papers co-authored by Henry Thompson and David McKelvie, with the participation
            of Amy Isard and
            Chris Brew (
            <div class="xref e297" linkend="thompson-mckelvie97"></div>, 
            <div class="xref e298" linkend="mckelvieetal98"></div>, 
            <div class="xref e299" linkend="isardetal98"></div>). They were mostly made in the context of the LT NSL package (later to become LT
            XML), created at the
            University of Edinburgh. In these papers, the foundations for stand-off semantics
            were laid. Below, we look at
            some of the possible interpretations of stand-off links, the first four defined by
            the LT NSL group. Much of that
            has later surfaced in the XInclude and XLink specifications (the latter partially
            based on TEI pointing
            techniques).

                     multiple-point linking); correspondence semantics may be enough for visualising applications
                     – i.e., there
                     is no need to derive an extra TEI representation: all that the application has to
                     know is which fragments
                     of one layer correspond to which fragments of another, and that is enough to act on
                     them. Correspondence
                     semantics in also necessary in the case of multimodal corpora, where annotation layers
                     (in)directly address
                     binary streams. In the TEI, there exist a variety of devices for simple pointing,
                     from the @target
                     attribute (and the deprecated @targets), sometimes embedded in the

                     <div class="code e343">&lt;ref&gt;</div> elements, through the entire range of pointers with added shades of interpretation
                     beyond pointing or linking, such as @corresp, @ref or @ana, among many others (see

                     involves this kind of

            popular in corpus-linguistic circles. One of its most important features was that

         <div class="para e387">(X)CES hyperlink semantics was always stated in free prose and typically mentioned
            “annotations virtually
            added to the base document” – treated literally, it would result in something like
            the “reverse inclusion”
            mentioned above. However, while it is natural to be able to predict and shape the
            behaviour and composition of
            the document under the control of the annotator, i.e. the annotation document, it
            is not necessarily so with
            respect to the source. This means that at best, we can expect inclusion or replacement
            semantics here, although
            what was often meant in the XCES, we believe, might have been simply correspondence
            semantics, with redundant
            text fragments copied from the source text layer, somewhat in the manner of multiply-annotated
            text of e.g.

         <div class="para e414">In conclusion, it is also advisable to mention the concept of 
            <div class="quote e415">radical stand-off</div> that the XCES
            evolved into, in the context of the American National Corpus, which keeps the source
            files in the form of raw
            UTF-16 text and uses dedicated software (ANCTool) to merge the raw text with the annotations
            selected by the
            user, cf. 
            <div class="xref e416" linkend="ide-suderman06"></div>. Our interpretation of the the XCES evolving in the context of the ANC
            and ending up merely as one of the output formats of the ANCTool is that the creators
            of the ANC have drawn
            conclusions from the stalled development of the W3C XPointer standard, various versions
            of which the XCES
            attempted to use over the years, and finally gave up on it and switched to an in-house
            tool that made it possible
            for them to go all the way towards radical stand-off annotation, which undoubtedly
            has some advantages from the
            point of view of sustainability of LRs (the texts are kept as read-only, so there
            is no danger of corrupting them
            by fixes and adaptations of markup).

                     <div class="para e418">Another way to cope with the lack of XPointer support has been to use XPointer-like
                        attributes with
                        in-house tools. This is the case of the PAULA, as illustrated by a fragment of Figure

                        Such XPointers, however, would under the W3C definition return sequences of spans
                        rather than single spans --
                        what is missing is a position predicate that can be found in the OCTC listing above.

            of XPointer schemes was an ingenious move, because in theory, it should allow an OWL
            to be able to use TEI
            stand-off with ordinary off-the-shelf tools. In this section, we look at the various
            factors that conspire to
            what we believe is the undeserved lack of uptake of TEI stand-off devices. We divide
            these factors into external
            and internal, and among the latter, we make a distinction between technological and
            sociological.

            </div>
            <div class="para e502">As has been mentioned above, the TEI recommendations for stand-off annotation rely
               on
               the use of external standards, most importantly XInclude and the XPointer Framework,
               with
               its potential for defining third-party XPointer schemes. To cut a long story short:
               tool
               support for W3C XPointer schemes other than 
               <div class="code e503">element()</div> (obligatory for XInclude) and
               
               <div class="code e504">xmlns()</div> does not exist, as far as the popular XML parsers are
               concerned, and support for third-party schemes is scant.
            </div>
            <div class="para e505">It might be claimed that these issues are internal to the TEI, after all, because
               they
               depend on the TEI's internal choice to use XInclude and to use its own XPointer schemes
               for pointing
               into the text. However, there appears to be no alternative to the use of XPointer
               schemes
               for pointing into spans of characters (short of unwinding history back to the era
               of TEI
               extended pointers whence XPointer comes), and in this sense, the lack of support for
               XPointer's xpointer() scheme blocks the possible development of support for the TEI-defined
               schemes, because that support should ideally piggyback (in terms of data structures,
               basic
               mechanisms, etc.), on the support for the W3C-defined 
               <div class="code e506">xpointer()</div>.

                        <div class="para e508">It may be speculated that, since XInclude already allows for including raw text (as
                           a whole resource),
                           it should also be allowed to address into raw text (in the 
                           <div class="quote e509">extreme stand-off</div> fashion), with
                           appropriate XPointer schemes. For example, an appropriate scheme for addressing raw
                           text could be a variant
                           of the 
                           <div class="code e510">string-range()</div> function, e.g.

                           issues would have to be addressed at the application level (e.g. skipping the BOM
                           character, recognizing
                           character encoding, etc.), but on the whole, it does not feel particularly exotic
                           and would only require
                           lifting the XInclude ban on the simultaneous presence of 
                           <div class="code e512">@parse=”text”</div> and
                           
                           <div class="code e513">@xpointer</div> as well as an adjustment in the MIME types enumerated in the XPointer Framework
                           Recommendation. Both issues are demand-driven and potentially interrelated: if XInclude
                           were able to handle
                           addressing into raw text, interest in developing modular implementations of XPointer
                           schemes might follow.

               from using
               XInclude-based stand-off in favour of the underspecified semantics of the 
               <div class="code e526">@corresp</div> attribute that
               simply states correspondence between two elements (or an element and a span of characters),

               support – it does not work out-of-the-box despite the measures that the Guidelines
               took to ensure that the

               observations should be

               in the

               the W3C pointers or below 0
               in the case of TEI-defined pointer schemes) but becomes less than trivial when it
               comes to ensure that the
               maximal value of the pointer does not extend beyond the addressed string.

                                 only for morphosyntactic annotation). Furthermore, breaking TEI-conformance may mean

               Instead of concluding

         <div class="para e594">The TEI is a very good choice for complex corpus encoding with a view to sustainability
            and interoperability because, apart from its other virtues, it offers a 
            <div class="emphasis e595" role="ital">homogeneous</div> format for encoding all the annotations and storing “formal
            metadata” in the TEI headers – this point is made in 
            <div class="xref e596" linkend="bansp-adamp10"></div>, and
            illustrated in 
            <div class="xref e597" linkend="adamp-bansp10"></div>. However, at present, stand-off TEI deployment
            for such purposes requires dedicated visualisation and query tools acting on the
            correspondence semantics of hyperlinks (because XInclusions fail due to the lack of
            support for third-party
            XPointer schemes anyway), as well as some dedication to simplify parts of the architecture
            that are unduly complex for someone who wants to “just do it”, just create a stand-off
            annotation document without having to create a mock text document in the process.
         </div>
         <div class="para e598">Some of the necessary pieces of the puzzle are already there. Recall that the (X)CES
            used
            three different content models for annotating the source text, the annotations, and
            the
            alignment. We do not want to argue for that – that would not be as homogeneous a format
            as
            what the TEI offers currently. Instead, we would like to point out that it is possible
            to
            reabsorb the (X)CES inventions more fully into the current TEI model, by keeping text
            under
            
            <div class="code e599">&lt;text&gt;</div>, and non-text elsewhere. Let us have a look at the content model
            of the

            Another element that is planned to be included in this model, defined by a planned

            <div class="code e608">&lt;document&gt;</div> (

            <div class="code e612">&lt;dataSection&gt;</div> (to store, e.g.,

            <div class="code e617">&lt;standOff&gt;</div> for
            the same purpose. What this shows it that a need for an extra sibling of 
            <div class="code e618">&lt;text&gt;</div> is recognized
            in the community, and, in the case of 
            <div class="code e619">&lt;document&gt;</div>, it is actually being implemented.
            Implementing an element that could store stand-off markup would be the final, and
            in our view necessary, step in
            reabsorbing the XCES innovations into the TEI. It would simplify the content model
            for the annotation creators,
            making it possible for them not to abuse the semantics of 
            <div class="code e620">&lt;text&gt;</div>, and at the same time not to
            be bound by the requirements of 
            <div class="code e621">&lt;text&gt;</div>'s content model.
         </div>
         <div class="para e622">We sketch the possible configurations resulting from implementing this solution using
            
            <div class="code e623">&lt;standOff&gt;</div> because the name of this element corresponds with the topic of the present
            contribution. We note, however, that the name "standOff" is only used for the same
            of discussion and that e.g.
            Peter Boot's suggestion for the name of the element in question, namely 
            <div class="code e624">&lt;dataSection&gt;</div> sounds
            just as good, although perhaps too generic (everything here is data).
         </div>
         <div class="para e625">Recall that the TEI contains a range of elements with uses that we have referred to
            in
            
            <div class="xref e626" linkend="sect_TEI-local"></div>by the mildly fortunate term "local stand-off". They are elements
            that may sometimes be perfectly justified inside 
            <div class="code e627">&lt;text&gt;</div>, but there have
            been suggestions to move them into the teiHeader or (as in 
            <div class="xref e628" linkend="boot09"></div>) to move
            them to a sibling of 
            <div class="code e629">&lt;text&gt;</div>. We suggest that two of these solutions can be
            used, depending on the annotating task at hand (we reject the option of locating these
            elements in the header). Those who would rather separate the "local stand-off" elements
            from
            text proper, could use three child elements of 
            <div class="code e630">&lt;TEI&gt;</div> at the same time:
            
            <div class="code e631">{ teiHeader, standOff, text }</div>. The third group, the creators of the "classical"
            stand-off annotation levels, would use 
            <div class="code e632">{ teiHeader, text }</div> for text documents but
            
            <div class="code e633">{ teiHeader, standOff}</div> for annotations. This is not the place to suggest the
            content model of the putative 
            <div class="code e634">&lt;standOff&gt;</div> element – suffice it to say that
            we would expect it to hold, among others, elements from the "analysis" and "linking"
            parts of
            the TEI module inventory.

         <div class="title e661">7. Conclusion</div>
         <div class="para e662">The motivation for the present analysis was to flesh out certain inadequacies of the
            TEI approach to
            stand-off annotation, in order to see how many of the problems have causes internal
            to the TEI Guidelines, and
            how many can be attributed to external factors, such as the lack of sufficiently developed
            generic XML tools or
            the inadequacies of standards assumed by the TEI. The ultimate question, therefore,
            is: should the TEI be used
            for modern stand-off text encoding at all, or should developers turn to other formats,
            such as the excellent
            PAULA toolkit (cf. 
            <div class="xref e663" linkend="dipper05"></div>), the slightly aged XCES (
            <div class="xref e664" linkend="ideetal00"></div>) or the more
            generic but still incomplete LAF family of standards (
            <div class="xref e665" linkend="ide-romary07"></div>).
         </div>
         <div class="para e666">If the TEI wants to become a viable alternative to other formats, it should ensure
            that an OWL can easily
            implement and use a prototype stand-off corpus. This is conditioned by two factors:
            one internal (making content
            models of stand-off documents maximally friendly and packaging them for out-of-the-box
            deployment) and one
            external (the lack of generic parsing tools that would implement XInclude with third-party
            XPointers schemes,
            ideally as modules). Both issues are solvable. Both would normally be solved by community
            pressure but the
            community (sub-community of NLP-oriented TEI users) has yet to be formed and in its
            absence, it is the rest that
            should act, for the sake of making the TEI community richer and more dynamic, and
            in this way, to supply all of
            us with new ideas and research topics, and new tools (including better support for
            stand-off document creation,
            visualisation and querying) to go with them, because tools follow users. We have identified
            three classes of
            problems, all tied together. In order to move on, the tie should be cut, preferably
            at a few places at the same
            time.

            annotation has been considered for inclusion in the Guidelines but never ended up
            finished and included. We
            believe to have shown here that that chapter, after considerable revisions, might
            be one of the ways in which the
            TEI reaches out to OWLs interested in corpora, whether of the purely textual or the
            multimodal kind. The nascent
            Special Interest Group for linguists (
