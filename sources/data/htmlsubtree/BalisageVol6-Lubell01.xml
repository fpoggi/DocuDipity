               Product data can be usefully defined as structured information about
               objects that are produced by industrial and business processes. In
               terms of information types, data formats, usage, and lifespan, product
               data is both complex and diverse, encompassing 3D image
               modeling information, dimensions, tolerances, and other model
               annotations, supplementary material such as test analysis, videos,
               datasets, and human-readable documentation. Although the metadata
               issues in this problem space present some unique challenges, there are
               valuable lessons to be learned from the library metadata and packaging
               standards and how they relate to product metadata. Extending the
               library standards to represent subsets of information from emerging
               product lifecycle management standards could help tame the complexity
               of long-term archival of product data.

            considers to be a product, product data is overwhelmingly used in
            practice to mean structured information about things produced by
            industrial or business processes.

         <div class="para e45">
            
            Prior to the digital information age, product geometry was specified
            using technical drawings on paper. These drawings were copied using
            blueprint and other reproduction methods. [
            <div class="xref e46" linkend="blueprint"></div>] The drawings were often archived on microfiche, a
            medium which can last as long as 100 or more years. [
            <div class="xref e47" linkend="microfiche"></div>] Nowadays many Computer Aided Design (CAD)
            systems provide a means for engineers to specify product data through
            annotated 3D digital models. Thus the de facto definition of a
            product is no longer drawing-based, but rather is model-based.

            Product data is complex and diverse, both in terms of information
            types and in terms of formats. Therefore, it is not surprising that useful
            long-term archiving of product data is difficult. Some reasons why are as
            follows:

                     Engineers often want the digital models and systems they
                     build today to be extensible and reusable by subsequent generations of
                     technologists. This requirement presents a challenge as a digital product
                     model may have a longer lifespan than the data formats, application
                     software and computing platforms used to create the model.

                     Archived digital product models should be semantically rich enough to
                     address long-term socio-technical concerns such as forensics (accident
                     and incident investigation) and environmental issues (carbon
                     footprint, disposal). For example, the former might require
                     representation of the rationale behind design decisions, while the
                     latter might require a product model highlighting any hazardous substances
                     needed to build a part.

                     Although content information standards such as STEP are a critical
                     ingredient for long term archiving, not all relevant content
                     information can be made available using standards. Standards' representational capabilities
                     sometimes
                     lag behind those of information models implemented in commercial software, as
                     vendors are constantly adding new enhancements to distinguish their
                     offerings from the competition. Thus content information may use a mix
                     of standard and proprietary formats.

            Product Manufacturing Information (PMI) is a particularly critical
            constituent of product data. Loosely defined, PMI can include any sort
            of information defining a product’s components for manufacturing,
            inspection and sustainment. PMI includes geometric dimensions and
            tolerances (GD&amp;T) specified in a formal language whose syntax and
            semantics are defined in several American Society of Mechanical
            Engineers (ASME) and ISO standards. PMI is essential to product
            data. Manufacturing cannot take place without it. Today's CAD systems
            must support not only the ability to edit and display PMI, but also
            must be able to feed GD&amp;T semantics to computer-aided
            manufacturing (CAM) systems and other downstream applications. [

            Manufacturers recognize the need for long-term archiving of digital
            product data and the challenges associated with doing so. As a result,
            industry-led standardization efforts are beginning to emerge. The most
            prominent and farthest along of these is LOTAR (LOng Term ARchiving),
            a suite of standards being developed by an international consortium of
            aerospace companies. [
            <div class="xref e81" linkend="lotar"></div>] LOTAR's approach is
            based upon the Open Archival Information System (OAIS) reference model
            [
            <div class="xref e82" linkend="oais"></div>], a framework widely adopted by archivists and
            preservationists. LOTAR favors the use of STEP in the archival
            process while recognizing the reality that a mix of product data
            archival formats must be supported.

            Of course the need for archiving information is not unique to product
            manufacturers, but in fact applies to many disciplines. For
            instance, those of us working in archival of digital products can
            learn much from librarians. They were among the first to embrace OAIS
            and have implemented numerous tools and standards for digital archives
            and repositories. In particular, they have long recognized the
            importance of metadata. Metadata is an information retrieval system's
            lifeblood. The choice and quality of metadata has a major impact not
            only on delivery of data, but also on long-term preservation of that
            data. [
            <div class="xref e84" linkend="gartner"></div>] Librarians understand this well and, in fact, have
            standardized a multitude of metadata vocabularies, many of them based
            on the Extensible Markup Language (XML). [
            <div class="xref e85" linkend="xml"></div>]

            Similarly, this paper takes a metadata-centric approach to product data
            archiving. The

            unique to long-term product data access and how these requirements fit

               A key challenge in long-term archiving is ensuring that information be
               available in the best form for whatever access scenarios the future
               might bring. This is particularly true for product data.
               When validating engineering knowledge, it is crucial to be able to
               replicate the intended behavior of a designed artifact. Successful
               validation requires that the information be available in forms
               sufficiently supporting retrieval and reuse. The need to know a
               designer’s intent becomes important in the context of redesign and
               reuse of existing parts. Another important aspect of engineering
               archiving is the ability to store the digital objects at different
               levels of granularity and abstractions as required by design
               decision making tasks. Without the ability to compose different
               digital objects for archiving, it would not be possible to maintain
               the ability to encode rationale or reuse-based access needs.

               display, paper, etc.). 
               <div class="emphasis e116" role="ital">Reuse</div> is the

               The primary driver for the 3Rs is the specific retrieval needs of each
               of these scenarios. For example, a product data repository intended
               primarily for reference may need to be organized differently than one
               intended for reuse, where not only the geometric aspects of the
               product are sought but also additional information regarding
               manufacturing, performance requirements, assembly, and other aspects. In a
               similar vein, rationale may require content being organized in a different manner
               to support the inclusion of requirements information along with

               uses and perspectives of the end users, their needs will have a large
               impact on the process of archiving and retrieval.

               As discussed in the 
               <div class="xref e122" linkend="sec-challenges"></div>, many formats are used to
               represent product model data. Some are native to a specific software
               application. Others are neutral with respect to software
               applications. Some are proprietary. Others are open or
               standards-based. The selection of the product model data format
               depends upon factors such as the type of data defined in the product
               model, design stage, and the availability of translators. Because an
               archive must capture all of the data required to completely define the
               product and associated processes, the archive may need a variety of
               data formats, possibly causing redundancies. Good metadata is
               essential for helping consumers evaluate the quality of data accessed
               from the archive.

               Native formats are typically binary, proprietary, and have a
               specification not available to the general public. In spite of
               long-term access concerns, archiving the native data is done as a
               matter of course because it has such a small impact on resources and
               because it is universally accepted as a good system management
               practice. [
               <div class="xref e124" linkend="kassel"></div>] STEP provides an open alternative
               to native formats for long-term retention of product
               information. Because STEP is an international standard developed by
               consensus, it is less subject to change than a proprietary format.

               STEP application protocols (APs) specify information models for a
               specific engineering domain. STEP physical files (informally known as
               Part 21 files or STEP files) use an ASCII format defined in ISO
               10303-21. [
               <div class="xref e126" linkend="iso10303-21"></div>] A STEP processor can be any
               software application capable of interpreting and/or generating STEP
               physical files, for example a computer-aided design (CAD) tool capable
               of importing and exporting STEP files, or a visualization tool that
               can import STEP data. The objects represented and exchanged using
               STEP, as well as the associations between these objects, are defined
               in schemas written in EXPRESS (ISO 10303-11) [
               <div class="xref e127" linkend="iso10303-11"></div>], a product data information modeling
               language. Recognizing the popularity of XML as an implementation
               method, the developers of STEP later standardized Part 28 [
               <div class="xref e128" linkend="iso10303-28"></div>], specifying an alternative representation of
               STEP schemas and data using XML.

               Although open non-proprietary standardized formats are desirable for
               long-term data retention, even information represented using
               standards-based methods is subject to format change. For example,
               consider a long-term archival scenario from the domain of shipbuilding
               [
               <div class="xref e132" linkend="kassel"></div>] attempting to maximize the use of STEP to
               represent detail design product model data.

               Although there are STEP APs that define information models well-tailored to the
               ship domain, these APs have not yet been implemented in commercial
               off-the-shelf software. Other APs such as AP203
               (configuration controlled 3D design) and AP214 (core data for
               automotive mechanical design processes) are supported by today’s CAD
               software applications, but the information models of these APs cannot represent
               some concepts specific to shipbuilding. So how might ship data be archived, given
               this
               imperfect state of affairs? Initially, the data is created in a native
               format, and the neutral file format is selected as a function of the
               quality of the available translators. If the desired translators are
               not available, a compromise is made in order to allow the data to be
               accessible to the applications used during a specific design
               phase where access to this neutrally represented data is required. The evolution from
               this point forward could be as follows.

               First, geometry is exchanged using any means possible, but most
               likely using AP214 or AP203. The non-graphical data can be extracted
               separately and saved in a project-specific XML format. The XML often
               contains only basic product structure, enabling minimal
               exchange of geometric data, graphics, and basic properties. It also has the
               greatest potential for minimizing the dependency on a particular CAD
               vendor.

               A more desirable long-term solution would be for the product model

               standard) [
               <div class="xref e136" linkend="plcs"></div>] to define product structure, the
               relationships between objects, and reference data libraries to define
               an extensible set of properties. The

               Assuming future vendor support, the ideal long-term solution would be
               to employ implementations of AP214 for general purpose geometry and
               PLCS for configuration management and product structure. This approach would be further
               enhanced by defining application-specific product model data using APs with a more
               specific scope, such as the shipbuilding APs.

               In summary, even with a policy favoring STEP for representing product
               information, the detail design data may manifest itself in many
               different formats, each conforming to a different AP, or in some
               cases not conforming to STEP at all. Over the life of the product,
               format choices will evolve as a function of the product model
               complexity, the quality of the translators, and the evolution of the
               standard itself. Therefore, the goal of a single standard to represent
               product model data may not be realistic, and we should be prepared to
               encounter multiple formats over the lifecycle of a product.

               I begin by addressing the second question, surveying some of the more
               widely adopted XML-based metadata vocabularies for digital
               libraries. The Metadata Encoding and Transmission Standard (METS)
               [
               <div class="xref e151" linkend="mets"></div>] specifies an XML schema [
               <div class="xref e152" linkend="xsd"></div>] for encoding packaging information and is extensible
               such that other vocabularies can be incorporated for encoding PDI and
               DI. METS Profiles, detailed and unambiguous descriptions of classes of
               METS instances, are used to document METS schema extensions and
               customizations. The PREMIS (
               <div class="emphasis e153" role="bold">Pre</div>servation 
               <div class="emphasis e154" role="bold">M</div>etadata:

               [
               <div class="xref e157" linkend="premis"></div>] define a vocabulary suitable for
               representing PDI. METS and PREMIS are often combined to create a more expressive schema,
               though there are some inconsistencies and overlaps. [
               <div class="xref e158" linkend="guenther"></div>] Dublin Core (DC) [
               <div class="xref e159" linkend="dc"></div>] and the Metadata Object Description Schema (MODS)
               [
               <div class="xref e160" linkend="mods"></div>] are both vocabularies for descriptive
               metadata and are easy to integrate with METS. MODS offers more
               precision than DC, but DC is more widely used. [
               <div class="xref e161" linkend="gartner"></div>]

            <div class="para e162">
               
               An additional advantage of DC is that it is encoded using the Resource
               Description Framework (RDF). [
               <div class="xref e163" linkend="rdf"></div>] RDF's simple,
               modular data model facilitates extensions to DC. The wide variety of
               software tools available for RDF can be used to edit, process, and
               query DC metadata. Most important, it is easy to merge and harmonize
               RDF metadata from heterogeneous sources. The importance of this last
               benefit will become clearer later on in this paper.

               Given the variety and widespread adoption of digital library metadata
               vocabularies, it would seem that these vocabularies could be helpful
               for encoding the packaging information, PDI, and DI needed for a
               product data information package. But there is one big caveat, and
               this is that the DI requirements for product data archives differ
               significantly from those of digital libraries, as previously discussed
               in the

               distinctions such as the 3Rs, product model evolution, and changing
               data formats are outside the scope of the digital library metadata
               standards.

               question by looking at two potential metadata sources unique to the
               world of product data: technical data packages (TDPs) and product data
               and lifecycle management (PDM/PLM) information. A TDP defines and aggregates the
               information objects needed to support a specific activity in a
               product's lifecycle, and is analogous to OAIS packaging
               information. PDM/PLM information is highly detailed metadata used to

               <div class="xref e176" linkend="fig-infopackage"></div>, an OAIS
               information package is a container bound via packaging information,
               inside of which is content as well as PDI providing the administrative
               metadata needed for long-term preservation of the content. DI is
               domain-sensitive metadata used to facilitate information retrieval
               from the archive.  XML metadata standards for digital libraries (shown
               as hexagons) provide vocabularies for representing packaging
               information, PDI, and DI. However, the digital library vocabularies
               for DI do not address product data-specific retrieval concerns.

               The options selection worksheet and accompanying instructions in
               MIL-STD-31000 imply a schema for TDP metadata. Instances of the
               implicit schema can be thought of as contracts between various parties
               in a product's lifecycle specifying the TDP contents needed for the
               lifecycle activity. The TDP metadata and contents vary depending on
               the activity, actors, and lifecycle stage. For example, consider a TDP
               supporting procurement by an aircraft manufacturer of a jet engine
               from a tier 1 supplier versus a TDP supporting maintenance of the
               aircraft. The procurement TDP might require a 3D model (or
               visualization) specifying PMI needed for the supplier to manufacture a
               jet engine compatible with the aircraft design. The TDP supporting
               maintenance, on the other hand, might require technical manuals and
               troubleshooting documentation.

               From an OAIS viewpoint, a TDP is an information package that may
               contain any
               content and metadata necessary for a product to be designed,
               manufactured, purchased and/or maintained. Recalling 
               <div class="xref e192" linkend="fig-infopackage"></div>, the library metadata standards
               collectively can represent much of an information package's metadata. But can
               these standards also represent TDP metadata? To answer this question,
               consider the following four top-level elements of the METS
               schema. 
               <div class="code e193">&lt;dmdSec&gt;</div> defines an information package's DI (represented with
               embedded Dublin Core or MODS). 
               <div class="code e194">&lt;admSec&gt;</div> defines the information
               package's PDI (with embedded PREMIS markup). 
               <div class="code e195">&lt;fileSec&gt;</div> specifies the
               locations and grouping of files comprising the information
               package. 
               <div class="code e196">&lt;structMap&gt;</div> defines the information package's lexical
               structure and relates it to the files in 
               <div class="code e197">&lt;fileSec&gt;</div>.

            <div class="para e198">
               
               Now consider the TDP option selection worksheet in 
               <div class="xref e199" linkend="fig-tdp"></div>. 
               <div class="xref e200" linkend="table-mets-tdp"></div> shows how the
               numbered sections of the worksheet could map into the top-level METS
               elements. The table is a first step toward demonstrating the
               feasibility of using library standards to encode TDP metadata. As
               mentioned in the 
               <div class="xref e201" linkend="sec-reqts"></div>, DI is the most
               domain-sensitive component of information package metadata. Looking at
               the TDP metadata, it indeed seems to be true that the DI (e.g.,
               TDP level, applicability of PMI standards) is more unique to product
               data and more challenging to encode using library standards than the
               non-DI metadata (e.g., CAGE codes, document numbers).

               Given the preceding discussion, it stands to reason that success using
               the library standards approach to represent TDP metadata hinges on
               being able to extend library DI standards (MODS or Dublin Core) such
               that they can be used within a METS instance to specify TDP
               descriptive metadata. Because Dublin Core is encoded in RDF and has
               provisions for defining application profiles (context-specific
               extensions to the basic DC metadata terms) [
               <div class="xref e231" linkend="dcap"></div>],
               it appears to be the strongest candidate for representing TDP DI.
               Thus the discussion in this section suggests that using METS and
               Dublin Core is a promising approach for
               encoding a TDP in a manner interoperable with digital repository
               frameworks and other software applications supporting library metadata
               standards. By creating TDP-specific application profiles for METS and
               Dublin Core, these standards can represent
               the TDP metadata elements specified in MIL-STD-31000.

               Product Data Management systems have evolved over the years from
               simple file managers for engineering drawings into complex software
               suites satisfying a wide variety of functions. Currently supported
               capabilities include version control of product models,
               management of design modifications, and management of engineering and
               business processes. A thorough discussion of PDM systems would require
               a paper all its own, and those who wish to learn more are encouraged
               to read Srinivasan's chapter in

               PDM systems is essentially product metadata. Because of the
               complexities of product data, PDM systems must provide very rich
               vocabularies for describing parts, people, resources, documents,
               activities, and other entities involved in the design, manufacturing,
               and support of products.

               Since PDM is such an integral part of product development, STEP not
               only supports the exchange of 3D product geometry and PMI but also
               supports the exchange of PDM information as well. Ongoing growth of the
               capabilities of PDM systems has resulted in the emergence of newer
               standards that build upon the STEP information model for PDM. The
               newest of these standards is the Product Lifecycle Support (PLCS)

               The PLCS RDL provides a comprehensive and fine-grained source
               of product metadata. But DI need only be sufficient for facilitating
               access to an archival information system. Therefore DI should be
               coarser-grained and less encompassing than PLCS. The good news is
               that, thanks to the RDL being encoded in OWL — a language built
               upon RDF — reference data subsets can easily be extracted and
               combined with DI represented using Dublin Core. The challenge is
               determining the subsets to extract. Analysis of access use cases
               similar to those discussed in 
               <div class="xref e268" linkend="sec-reqts"></div> can guide the
               selection of the RDL subsets.

            In this paper, I explained why it is difficult to archive product data,
            discussing requirements and challenges unique to engineering. Next, I
            surveyed some of the more widely used metadata standards from the
            digital library community and argued that, although they could be
            useful in a product data archival system, they need augmentation in
            order to represent product data Descriptive Information. I then
            discussed two sources of product metadata — the options
            selection worksheet for Technical Data Packages and the PLCS Reference
            Data Library. While TDP metadata is of a top-down nature and maps well
            to METS, the PLCS RDL is extremely detailed and is more
            bottom-up. However, useful DI should be extractable from the RDL by
            considering potential long-term access scenarios. This RDL subset 
            can then serve to enrich the more generic Dublin Core metadata terms
            standardized by Dublin Core Metadata Initiative. [
            <div class="xref e272" linkend="dcmi"></div>]
            
            
         </div>
         <div class="para e273">
            
            The next step is to test the effectiveness of these ideas by developing
            a METS profile for TDPs and implementing a product data ingest and
            access prototype. The prototype should support one or more access
            scenarios, with the scenario's data requirements determining the subset to be
            extracted from the RDL. The METS descriptive metadata (
            <div class="code e274">&lt;dmdSec&gt;</div>) section
            should contain RDF-encoded Dublin Core combined with the RDL subset,
            using semantic technologies to merge and harmonize the 
            information. If successful, the METS profile and prototype implementation
            could benefit developers and implementers of product data archival standards.
