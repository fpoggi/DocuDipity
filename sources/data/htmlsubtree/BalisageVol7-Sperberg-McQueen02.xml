         and listening to things other people have done, including (or even
         especially including) things we don’t expect in advance to
         find especially interesting, can open our minds to new possibilities.
         And opening new possibilities is, in a way, how many of us presumably
         got here.

      <div class="para e21">One reason to get interested in a new technology or a new
         programming language or a new markup language or a new kind of
         document language is that it opens up possibilities that you
         didn’t have before.  By looking at SGML and thinking about what
         SGML gave us, those of us who got interested in descriptive markup
         in the form of SGML learned about ways in which WordPerfect or
         WordStar or Waterloo Script or troff had been closing down
         possibilities for us — possibilities we hadn’t missed
         because we hadn’t thought about them, because the tool shapes the
         hand that wields it and the intellectual tool shapes the mind that
         uses it.  If your document description language is focused, as so
         many of them were and are, on putting ink on paper, then you’re
         going to think that document description and information management
         is about fonts and layout.  And it’s only when you get a language
         that says, “No, documents are about more than that.” (a
         language that ironically received much of its original impetus from
         typesetters, who know perfectly well that fonts can change in
         different renderings of the same document) — it’s only when
         you see that that you begin to think about other possibilities.  
         
      </div>
      <div class="para e22">And that opening up of possibilities can easily give you the
         sense that you are seeing the dawn of a new day.
      </div>
      <div class="para e23">That’s why some of us at least got interested in
         descriptive markup as opposed to WYSIWYG.  (As Brian Kernighan is
         quoted as saying, “The problem with ‘what you see is
         what you get’ is that what you see is all you get.”
         And when that’s all you’ve ever gotten, you may not miss the
         things that it doesn’t give you.)  That’s one of the reasons
         that other people got interested in XML as opposed to straight
         HTML. That’s one reason people get interested in multiple
         languages instead of a single language or, generalizing, in
         a metalanguage as opposed to an object language.
      </div>
      <div class="para e24">New technologies can open new possibilities.  So new specs
         defining new technologies are always interesting. In this context
         recall the papers we got from Cornelia Davis about the systematic
         application of new specs in the XML space (and some old specs in
         the XML space!) to make new things possible [
         <div class="xref e25" linkend="Davis"></div>], or Eric Freese’s report on EPUB3 [
         <div class="xref e26" linkend="Freese"></div>], or Piotr Bański’s application of
         the TEI ODD system to the ISO Linguistic Markup Framework [
         <div class="xref e27" linkend="Banski"></div>].  All of these are showing us ways of opening
         up new possibilities.
      </div>
      <div class="para e28">Sometimes new views on existing specs can open up some
         surprising perspectives, as we found on Tuesday, when
         Hans-Jürgen Rennau reported on the work that he and David Lee
         had done on XDML [
         <div class="xref e29" linkend="Rennau"></div>].  And sometimes we get
         new perspectives, new possibilities, from the collision of
         existing specs: think of Kurt Cagle talking about the collsion of
         XQuery and SparQL [
         <div class="xref e30" linkend="Cagle"></div>].  In the other track
         about the same time, Julien Seinturier had some very interesting
         remarks about the different way that domain specialists — in
         his case, linguists — react to XQuery and SparQL [
         <div class="xref e31" linkend="Seinturier"></div>] that made me think about ways it might
         make sense to change what I teach when I teach XQuery.
      </div>
      <div class="para e32">Sometimes the collision with other specs leads us to seek
         better ways of co-existence.  You know, sometimes you’d really
         like to conquer the world and get the other spec out of the way.
         (SGML did manage to displace ODA; that was a long hard struggle,
         but I haven’t heard anybody but SGML people mention ODA for a
         long, long time.)  But in the short term, XML is going to co-exist
         with JSON for quite a while, so I’m glad to see David Lee
         looking for a way to get back-and-forth without information loss
         and with at least reasonably plausible translation results so the
         product of the transformation doesn’t always sound like the
         output of a badly trained machine translation program [
         <div class="xref e33" linkend="Lee"></div>].  Even within the XML community, XQuery and
         XSLT are going to co-exist for a while, so Evan Lenz’s ideas
         for hybridizing them may give us new perspectives for the future
         [
         <div class="xref e34" linkend="Lenz"></div>].
      </div>
      <div class="para e35">People talk about turning over a new leaf.  It took me a long
         time to understand that idiom.  Eventually, I concluded that in
         its original sense it refers to a school boy who has spoiled one
         page by spilling too much ink turning over a new page, and now
         it’s a fresh new opening.  There’s nothing wrong with this
         new leaf; it’s full of possibility.  The French poet,
         Stéphane Mallarmé, talks about this.  He talks about
         the empty page whose blankness defends it.

                     <div class="xref e41" linkend="Mallarme"></div>]; there are also numerous copies on the
                     Web.

               </div>
            </div>
         </div> Why does the blankness 
         <div class="quote e42">defend</div> the page?
         Because the page is currently full of possibilities, and as soon
         as I write a word on it, I’ve spoiled an infinite number of
         them.  This thought can lead to paralysis, of course.

      <div class="para e43">Sometimes those of us who are predicting the dawn of a new day
         will also assume or predict that everyone is going to see the
         beauty of these possibilites, rejoice in them, and adopt this new
         technology.  And sometimes the rosy possibilities that we foresee
         will accrue only if everybody does adopt the new technology. Some
         of you will be thinking, along about now, about all of the
         rhetoric that we regularly hear — I associate it especially
         with the web application development community — about the
         advantages of network effects and the advantages of ubiquity.  I

                  <div class="para e45">With the invention of the concept of

            </div>
         </div> has spawned
         (particularly in the IT community for some reason) a whole
         generation of intellectual social Darwinists who evaluate ideas
         exclusively in termes of how widely they spread, and not how how
         coherent or true they might be.  This is a sort of
         propagandists’ view of ideas, whose coarseness and
         naïveté would shame even the most outrageous of the
         19th century thinkers who invented that misapplication of
         biological theory to human ethics which is social
         Darwinism.
      </div>
      <div class="para e48">So it’s nice to have some cases where advantages will
         accrue and new possibilities will open up regardless of whether
         anybody else sees them or adopts the new technology or not, where
         the advantages accrue for individuals and not just huge
         collectives.  It's nice because it frees us from the need to make
         technological choices based solely on our predictions about what
         other people are going to think is good technology; it allows us
         to evaluate the technology on its merits.  As technical people,
         most of us are likely to be better at evaluating the technical
         merits of technologies than at predicting the crowd psychology of
         marketplaces.  As Michael Kay said several times during this
         conference, “I really hate to try to make predictions about
         the future.  It’s very hard.” That’s true for all of
         us.

                     markup is vastly superior to both presentational and procedural

                     on its becoming a standard; instead, descriptive markup is the
                     basis of the standard because of its inherent superiority over
                     other forms of markup.

         it can be an onerous responsibility.  As a well-known critic of

      <div class="para e78">Sometimes, possibly for this reason — it seems related
         — the way forward seems to be not to open up more
         possibilities but to start closing possibilities down. That’s
         why many people thought then and think now that Scribe was a step
         forward vis-à-vis troff.  Why?  Because it cut off a whole
         lot of spaces, particularly spaces of bad typography and bad
         document structure, and put a very limited palette of
         possibilities in front of the user.  It’s one of the things
         that the designers of XML tried to accomplish with XML: to close
         off some of the possibilities of SGML.  Let’s not fool
         ourselves; there is a loss of flexibility in XML vis-à-vis
         SGML.  The design goal was to make that loss of flexibility
         involve the things you don’t care about and not the things you
         do care about.  So XML doesn’t reduce possibilities for the
         document owners or the vocabulary designers, only for the software
         developers.  There’s a trade-off: You have to think
         “Which is more valuable to you?  Having more conforming
         parsers than you can count on the fingers of a single hand (and
         more non-conforming parsers than you can count on fingers and
         toes, and possibly some fingers and toes of some friends)?  Or, on
         the other hand, the ability to use backslash rather than ampersand
         as a general entity reference opener?” On the whole, I’m
         happy to give up on a backslash as a general entity reference open
         delimiter in order to have more parsers.  So I’m happy with
         that trade-off.  And those of us who prefer to use SGML can still
         use SGML because it’s there; it’s a spec, and its
         implementations are not going away, although, as far as I know,
         most of them have not been updated recently.

      <div class="para e79">That same simplification through reducing choices is probably
         responsible for the fact that many, many more people use TEI-Lite
         than full TEI.  You can’t use full TEI without making an awful
         lot of decisions.  Quite often they’re decisions that you
         don’t feel in a position to make upfront because until
         you’ve had some experience you don’t know whether you want
         that module or not.  Blind interchange similarly requires closing
         off possibilities and reducing variation. (We’ll come back to

         possible texts in order to get the text he did write, and he had
         to risk an ink blot or two.  Similarly, growing up requires that
         you stop changing your mind about what you want to be when you
         grow up and start focusing; at least, that’s what I’ve been
         told by people who have grown up.

      <div class="para e82">Even at relatively low levels, regularity, predictability, and
         explicit structure can open up new possibilities.  The simple
         regularity of markup — the ability to distinguish markup
         from non-markup — allows Daniel Jettka and Maik
         Stührenberg to produce tools to do visualization of documents
         [
         <div class="xref e83" linkend="Jettka"></div>].  You know, visualizing the structure of TeX
         documents or troff documents would be an NP-complete problem.  It
         would require artificial intelligence because you would
         essentially have to write a troff processor and then you’d have
         to do artificial intelligence to analyze the shape of the page to
         decide what the structure of the document was.  Having the
         structure explicitly marked allows Jettka and Stührenberg to
         draw trees without occupying the mainframe computer center for
         three weeks in order to document the structure of the first
         document they try, and then another three weeks to get the second
         one to compare with it.  Consider the paper of Jean-Yves
         Vion-Dury, in which he exploits the distinction between markup and
         content in order to encrypt them differently so that you can
         semi-trust people, semi-trusting your service vendors so they can
         perform operations without having to understand either the
         operations or your documents fully [
         <div class="xref e84" linkend="Vion-Dury"></div>].  You couldn’t do that if you
         didn’t have a reliable guide to the structure that you’re
         exposing to them (or, in some cases, potentially hiding from them)
         independent of the content.  Or recall the work that Jacques
         Durand did in XTemp [
         <div class="xref e85" linkend="Durand"></div>]; I think that’s
         aided by
         the generality at one level and the utter predictability at
         another level of the message structure of the messages they have
         to deal with.

      <div class="para e86">Now, the difficulties of uncertainty and freedom, and the
         advantages of restriction — I’m tempted to say
         “voluntary slavery” — apply not just at the
         psychological level and not just at the application level (even at
         a very low level).  Why are Michael Kay and O’Neil Delpratt
         able to optimize certain things and not others [
         <div class="xref e87" linkend="Delpratt"></div>]?  They are able to optimize those things
         which they can decide at compile time, and they cannot optimize
         things which cannot be determined until run time.  If they know,
         at compile time, that certain things are not going to happen at
         run time, then they can compile into byte code, and the stylesheet
         can run faster. Freedom leads to uncertainty, and uncertainty
         leads to doubt, and doubt leads to ... slower processing ... at
         many, many levels.

      <div class="para e88">Eliminating the possibilities that you don’t want to
         exercise can help in a lot of ways.  To inter-operate with other
         software, to make XML data more tractable for people who don’t
         have an XML mindset requires clean APIs — requires APIs like
         the one Liam Quin sketched, which try to make XML easier to write
         for people who don’t think in XML [
         <div class="xref e89" linkend="Quin"></div>].  We
         may wish that they would just start using native XML programming
         languages like XQuery and XSLT, but historically they have
         perversely enough exercised their freedom not to do so. And rather
         than putting them in chains and forcing them, it’s probably a
         good idea to try to make things easy. Similarly, I’m happy to
         see the work on XML serialization into C# and Java Objects that
         Carlos Jaimez-Gonzalez described [

         Maloney described this morning [
         <div class="xref e91" linkend="Maloney"></div>].  To
         make progress on certain tasks, including the development of
         applications, can just require that you put your head down and you
         make decisions and you put a stake in the ground and you risk an

         the perennial problem “Oh, this is really interesting, but
         who is actually going to pay for this additional work for the

         beings can do things in a whole lot of different ways.  We can
         understand each other because out of the infinite number of
         possible human languages, there is only a finite number of human
         languages actually in use at any given time and an even smaller
         finite number that are typically used in a particular location. So
         if we address each other in 21st-century English or 21st-century
         French, here in Montréal, we’re likely to succeed fairly
         quickly in finding a language that our interlocutor understands.
         Fortunately, we can restrict our attention to 21st-century English
         and 21st-century French — We don’t have to experiment
         with Chaucerian English or Old High German or Gothic or Uyghur or
         historical versions of that very large number of attested
         languages. But if we want to preserve our information for the
         long-term, the recipients of that information in the long-term
         won’t have all of the context that we have that reduces the
         number of possibilities we have to try. So as David Dubin reminded
         us the other day [
         <div class="xref e97" linkend="Dubin"></div>], we are going to have to document things a
         lot better than we might think.  It is precisely those things
         which are so obvious that we don’t think of them as needing
         documentation, the things that would be almost an insult to say
         explicitly (because it would make your interlocutor wonder whether
         you doubt their mental capacity) that may be most important to
         document.  So I’m glad that people like David Dubin or people
         like Daan Broeder and Andreas Witt and Oliver Schonefeld and their
         colleagues are working on long-term preservation [

         a subset?” And I said, rather guardedly, “Why do you
         want to know?” I had worked enough with Dan that I was
         worried about a trap.  And he said, “It’s just a sort of
         intellectual hygiene; it’s part of the definition of any set.
         Modern set theory says if you want to make sure that it’s safe
         to apply the axioms and theorems of set theory, you have to define
         sets in certain ways to avoid well-known intellectual
         problems.” And I said, “You know, I really don’t
         think that we’re going to run into Russell’s Paradox if we
         don’t specify whether an XML document is a string of characters
         or an abstract structure of some kind, so no, I don’t want to

                     question leads directly to a contradiction.

                     Over the years, mathematicians have proposed a number of rules
                     for the definition of sets whose primary motivation is to
                     ensure that no analogue of Russell's Paradox can arise in the
                     system so constrained; the rule mentioned by Dan Connolly is
                     imposed by Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory, which is the most
                     commonly used axiomatic system for set theory.

         Group thought about this problem; Dan and I, I think, were talking
         offline, and I resisted because I did not want to nail down the
         nature of an XML document in a specific way because I foresaw that
         other people would use that to sort of close down other
         possibilities.  And the result has, of course, cost later working
         groups some indeterminate number of months or years

         trying to patch problems in the formal underpinnings of their
         specifications.  Some XML specifications, for example, appeal to
         the notion of identity of XML elements — these two things,
         they may say, are the same if they are, or are derived from, the
         same XML element.  Sometimes, working group members are surprised
         to discover that their specification has a hole in its foundation
         as a result, since the XML spec doesn’t actually define
         identity criteria for XML documents or XML elements.  If identity
         is not defined for XML elements, you cannot appeal to identity of
         XML elements to determine the identity or non-identity of other
         things of interest to your specification.

         Trying to avoid nailing things down may be understandable when

         essential kind of question that we need to ask. I’m grateful to
         Walter Perry for asking a related question [

                     who didn't attend the conference, that this did in fact happen
                     to Walter Perry, who took it in stride.

         </div> But we have to ask these questions; it will take us a
         while to find answers that we can successfully communicate to each
         other, but if we don’t ask the questions, we’re never going
         to get there.  And I’m grateful to Lars Johnsen and Claus
         Huitfeldt for the same reason; I don’t understand what those
         lattices they are talking about mean, but I now know there’s
         something I have to work on understanding [
         <div class="xref e115" linkend="Johnsen"></div>].
      </div>
      <div class="para e116">But now we have a contradiction.  (Some of you will have
         noticed this some time ago, but it took me a while to get around
         to it.)  Now we have a contradiction because on the one hand we
         want openness and we want freedom and we want flexibility, but we
         notice that that sometimes leads to paralysis.  And on the other
         hand, we want to avoid closed-down options and foreclosure of
         possibilities and inflexibility and rigidity, but if we also want
         blind interchange and interoperability, that seems to be the way
         to get there.  How do we balance these competing interests?  Do we
         have to choose one and let the other one go to the dogs?  Can we
         trade them off somehow?  Do we have to choose whether to eat the
         cake today or save it for tomorrow?   Or can we have them both?
         And what I think of as the big theme of this conference is
         precisely the question: Can we have them both?  In his paper,
         Eliot Kimber explained the way DITA has striven to make the notion
         of architectural forms concrete and executable and managed to make
         DITA comprehensible in ways that I had ever managed to find it
         before [
         <div class="xref e117" linkend="Kimber"></div>].  The DITA approach, as he
         described it, seems to provide a way to have a certain kind of
         freedom within constrained limits and provide precisely the
         constraints that you need in order to allow at least a certain
         level of quality in default processing — to have at least
         some of the advantages of both poles.  And if things work right
         and if you get the right set of primitive types, maybe the
         advantages you have over here that are preserved and the
         advantages you have over there that are preserved and not lost are
         the ones you care about, and the advantages that you’ve lost
         are the ones you didn’t care about, like changing your
         delimiters.
      </div>
      <div class="para e118">Syd Bauman’s talk touched on that very topic of interchange
         and interoperability [
         <div class="xref e119" linkend="Bauman"></div>].  Wendell Piez
         discussed ways to provide controlled extension points, not just in
         the schema and not just outside the schema: having them both
         seemed to suggest a way that we may be able to manage those
         difficult trade-offs [
         <div class="xref e120" linkend="Piez"></div>].  I still don’t fully understand this, but the
         DITA mechanism that Eliot described and the local extensibility
         mechanisms that Wendell described feel to me similar at some deep
         level to the definition of forward processing in processor
         specs.
      </div>
      <div class="para e121">Another anecdote: The XML Schema Working Group was aware that
         versioning was a terribly difficult problem, and we were
         desperately afraid of getting it wrong, so in XSD 1.0 we in fact
         said nothing.  The XSLT Working Group — the group that
         developed XSLT 1.0 — was also aware that it was important,
         and they were also afraid of getting it wrong, but they took a
         risk and defined a forward processing mode for XSLT 1.0
         processors.  And as Michael (Kay), or anybody who has actually
         worked with XSLT 1.0 processors in the presence of XSLT 2.0
         stylesheets, will tell you, they didn’t get it completely
         right, and the parts they did get right weren’t always
         correctly implemented, but ask yourself: “Which set of users
         is currently in a better situation in the presence of new
         constructs?  The users of XSD 1.0 or the users of XSLT 1.0?”
         I am in both sets, and I tell you I am a lot happier as an XSLT
         programmer than I am as a schema writer, because the one way to be
         absolutely sure of getting it entirely wrong is to say nothing in
         a misguided attempt to leave all of your options open.
      </div>
      <div class="para e122">There comes a time for opening things up, and there is a time
         for closing things down.  One part of growing up is realizing that
         some problems don’t have a permanent solution, so the times
         for opening things up and the times for closing things down are
         likely to alternate, and you’ll have to decide what kind of
         time is this.  We’re not going to find any permanent
         solution to the problem of deciding which kinds of freedom we have
         to preserve and which kinds of voluntary slavery are worth entering
         into.  Those are questions that require human judgment.  One of the
         things we can do as technology people is to help make tools that
         will support that human judgment and allow humans to make human and
         humane judgments and not be consumed by clerical work.  To make
         those tools we are, from time to time, going to have to close down
         some possibilities, to keep things as simple as they can be (but
         remember security), to take a stand, to put a stake in the ground,
         to risk an ink blot, to work not just at a metalanguage level or the
         meta-metalanguage level or the meta-meta-metalanguage level, but
         — gasp! — at the object level, to write real documents
         and real vocabularies and to say relatively concrete things about
         relatively concrete entities.

      <div class="para e123">Right now it’s time to close down Balisage 2011 so you
         can all go home and do that work.  Soon enough it will be time for
         the pendulum to swing in the other direction, when what you will
         want to do is to think about the new things that you learned here
         that you haven’t thought before, to look at your problems
         from a new angle, to open up your mind again to new possibilities.
         I can think of a really good place to open up your mind to new
         possibilities, to do that kind of thing. So “So long!”
