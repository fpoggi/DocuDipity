         <div class="abstract e6">
            <div class="para e7">In the problem space of long-term preservation of digital objects, the disciplined
               use of XML affords a reasonable solution to many of the issues associated with ensuring
               the interpretability and renderability of at least some digital artifacts. This paper
               describes the experience of Portico, a digital preservation service that preserves
               scholarly literature in electronic form. It describes some of the challenges and practices
               entailed in processing and producing XML for the archive, including issues of syntax,
               semantics, linking, versioning, and prospective issues of scale, variety of formats,
               and the larger infrastructure of tools and practices required for the use of XML for
               the long haul.

         <div class="para e86">On September 5 1977, NASA launched the Voyager 1 satellite. Voyager 1 followed its
            previously-launched twin, Voyager 2, on a fly-by photo shoot of Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus,
            and Neptune, before heading past the heliosphere, into interstellar space.

                        The Voyager message is carried by a phonograph record-a 12-inch gold-plated copper
                        disk containing sounds and images selected to portray the diversity of life and culture
                        on Earth. The contents of the record were selected for NASA by a committee chaired
                        by Carl Sagan of Cornell University, et. al. Dr. Sagan and his associates assembled
                        115 images and a variety of natural sounds, such as those made by surf, wind and thunder,
                        birds, whales, and other animals. To this they added musical selections from different
                        cultures and eras, and spoken greetings from Earth-people in fifty-five languages,
                        and printed messages from President Carter and U.N. Secretary General Waldheim. Each
                        record is encased in a protective aluminum jacket, together with a cartridge and a
                        needle. Instructions, in symbolic language, explain the origin of the spacecraft and
                        indicate how the record is to be played. The 115 images are encoded in analog form.
                        The remainder of the record is in audio, designed to be played at 16-2/3 revolutions
                        per minute. It contains the spoken greetings, beginning with Akkadian, which was spoken
                        in Sumer about six thousand years ago, and ending with Wu, a modern Chinese dialect.
                        Following the section on the sounds of Earth, there is an eclectic 90-minute selection
                        of music, including both Eastern and Western classics and a variety of ethnic music.

            implicit in the XML and SGML files, including boilerplate text, punctuation, or white
            space that appears in the publisher's printed edition of a document but is only implicit
            in the mark-up. As part of its preservation strategy, Portico migrates these XML and
            SGML files to the NLM DTD as they are received, to ensure that the distinctive publisher
            vocabularies and their varying usages can be well understood while those knowledgable
            in their use are still available as resources.  Additionally, the uniform format enables
            Portico more efficiently to manage the archive at scale now and for the long haul.
         </div>
         <div class="para e162">Portico also uses XML as part of its processing system. XML registry files (format
            information, workflow tool lists, cross-walks from various format registry namespaces,
            metadata curation rule sets, workflow messages) drive the content preparation workflow
            system. An XML profile for each publisher stream defines the rules for associating
            the digital artifacts, distributed across the non-standard delivery packages described
            above, that comprise an archival unit such as a journal article.

         <div class="para e165">There are well-known and generally accepted reasons why both publishers and Portico
            would select XML as the format of choice for journal and e-book content and metadata,
            including the ability to provide rich structural and semantic metadata (
            <div class="xref e166" linkend="b05"></div>). Key to its selection as a long-term repository format is the fact that XML is not
            platform-specific, that there is a durable open public specification (at least for
            XML itself, and for the NLM archival format), and that there is a rich ecosystem of
            related open specifications (XSL, XPATH, XSCHEMA, etc.) and application tools (Java
            and other language libraries, Schematron, etc.). But there have been challenges as
            well.

            <div class="title e168">Syntax</div>
            <div class="para e169">Many business applications of XML entail the exchange of messages (i.e. content)
               between different entities – often outside a single organizational or corporate
               entity. This has the advantage of enforcing early detection of validity errors in
               that content: if the receiving party cannot parse the message you send, the feedback
               is often swift and noticeable. Prior to submission of their XML (and SGML) content
               to third-party archives for long term preservation, however, this was not
               necessarily the case for either the document type definitions (DTDs and schemas) nor
               the documents themselves produced by scholarly publishers. Content was processed by
               their internal systems only; and it was not always processed with standard tools
               that enforced well-formedness or validity. While this may have made for internal
               development or processing efficiencies, such practices open up the possibility that
               some content can “break” when users downstream in space or time, external to the
               producing entity, and operating under assumptions of either well-formedness or
               validity, attempt to read it using standard tools.
            </div>
            <div class="para e170">Some of the DTDs Portico has received failed validity tests. Some documents were
               not well-formed; some would not validate against the DTD or schema which defines
               them. Some document type declarations contained unresolvable public or system
               identifers. Some contained white space or comments before the XML declaration.
               Encoding declarations were sometimes omitted where the default (UTF-8) encoding was
               not the one employed by the document. Some documents incorrectly declared one
               encoding and employed another. Some documents declared they are instances of one
               version of a publisher DTD, but employed elements from a later version of that DTD.
               Some documents incorrectly declare that they are 
               <div class="quote e171">standalone.</div> Such
               errors are relatively rare -- comprising less than 1% of the content Portico has
               processed. They are also easily avoided –- by mandating and enforcing a check of
               well-formedness and validity 
               <div class="emphasis e172" role="ital">at the point of origin</div>
               of XML documents (as Portico itself does when it produces both normalized XML
               article content and XML metadata).
            </div>
            <div class="para e173">By policy, Portico does not ingest into the archive any XML full-text or
               bibliographic metadata document that does not pass well-formedness and validity
               tests. Portico maintains and preserves a local copy of every DTD or schema that
               defines XML content in the archive, along with (where permitted by contract) a copy
               of any supporting documentation the publisher provides. Portico uses these local
               copies to perform checks of well-formedness and validity. Access to a copy of the
               document type definition has proved essential for validation, in particular in the
               case of those definitions which include the use of defaults for attribute values.
               Portico has developed a set of Java filters to enable resolution of system
               identifiers to these locally-maintained document type definitions, to handle
               incorrect encoding or standalone declarations, and to stream past content before the
               XML declaration.
            </div>
            <div class="para e174">For many publishers, a single XML document is comprised of more than a single XML
               file. Sometimes the document fragments are referenced from within one of the files,
               as external parsed general entities. Often, however, there is no such intrinsic,
               express linking amongst the components of the document. The publisher's creating
               application 
               <div class="quote e175">assumes</div> that a downstream process (presumably one of the
               publisher's own) will 
               <div class="quote e176">know</div> how and where to inject these fragments.
               Any downstream process outside of the publisher's own workflow, of course, must
               reverse-engineer this association of components. The XML profiles described above
               provide the Portico workflow with sufficient information, typically based on file
               path and file name signatures, to associate the component files, and to pass them
               to
               a concatenating XSL transform prior to normalization. (The Portico-generated XML
               metadata that is associated with the archival artifact details the links among the
               components of a multi-file XML document, as well as the links from that document to
               the other supplemental files described above). A somewhat more challenging operation
               is required in the case where the constitutent files contain something other than
               XML fragments. The workflow has been instrumented to handle the case where one or
               more of the components of a document are fragments of HTML. These fragments are
               filtered using the 
               <div xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" class="link e177" xlink:actuate="onRequest" xlink:href="http://jtidy.sourceforge.net/" xlink:show="new" xlink:type="simple">JTIDY</div>
               tool to create well-formed fragments, and then are concatenated, along with other
               XML fragments, within a Portico-defined wrapper element, and are passed to a
               normalizing transform. The transforms similarly invoke JTIDY, wrapped in
               Portico-developed XSL extension functions, when a document comprised of just a
               single file contains HTML markup interspersed in the text.

            <div class="title e179">Semantics</div>
            <div class="para e180">A yet more subtle challenge to be faced in the use of XML as an instrument of
               long-term preservation is the issue of semantics. As Jerome McDonough has pointed
               out (
               <div class="xref e181" linkend="b13"></div>), information interchange even in the present between
               users of what nominally are the same XML vocabularies, but whose semantics are fact
               construed in different ways, is far from seamless. As Wendell Piez has discussed
               
               <div class="xref e182" linkend="b17"></div>, there is a gap between formalism (which lends itself
               easily to automated tools) and the meanings people attach to those formalisms. As
               Piez says, 
               <div class="quote e183">we cannot automate signification itself.</div>
            </div>
            <div class="para e184">To perform the normalization of the many publisher XML vocabularies in which
               content is received, Portico undertakes an intensive analysis of each publisher’s
               use (or, more commonly, given the frequent subcontracting of content creation to
               external vendors, uses) of its vocabularies, whether the DTD or schema is
               supplemented by publisher documentation or not. When a new publisher stream is
               initiated, Portico undertakes a non-automated (though aided with automated tools)
               investigation of the distinct contexts of all elements and attributes, the actual
               versus the possible use of element contexts or attribute values, and the
               manifestation of the content of those elements and attributes in print and online
               versions of the digital resource. XSL transformations to normalize that content to
               NLM are coded defensively: if the transformation encounters an element or attribute
               in a context not detected in the analysis, for example, an error is raised and
               processing of that document halts for investigation and, as required, modification
               of the transformation.
            </div>
            <div class="para e185">Portico's analysis of publisher content adumbrates the publisher DTD’s use of
               character entity files. These are analyzed for conformance to standard entity files
               and to identify publisher-specific non-Unicode private characters. Any discrepancies
               with the standard entity files are resolved with the publisher. Portico transforms
               any publisher character entities to Unicode where appropriate. Similarly, comments
               and processing instructions are scrutinized. Any part of the transform which results
               in making explicit the “generated text,” or implied data in a publisher document
               (described below), clearly labels the resulting elements as having been generated
               by
               the archive, and not by the publisher.
            </div>
            <div class="para e186">The transformations are tested in a setup environment which runs the same tools as
               the production content preparation system. The outputs on this setup system are
               subject to visual inspection by a quality assurance team. Only after this period of
               analysis and test are the publisher-specific tools directed to the production
               (archive ingest) system, where processed content is again sampled and subject to
               visual inspection after automated quality assurance checks have been performed, and

                  <div class="quote e216">procedural</div> semantics, whether from
                  syntactic cues in the XML document, or from a comparison of the source XML
                  document to its various renditions (in PDF, or on the publisher website)
                  manifests itself even when converting from what is nominally the same, or nearly
                  the same, document type definition. Nearly a third of the different publisher
                  vocabularies currently processed by Portico are some version or variant of the
                  NLM journal archiving or journal publishing DTDs. In theory, normalizing this
                  content should amount to not much more than an identity transform. In practise,
                  while these transforms are in fact considerably simpler than those from document types
                  outside of the NLM family, care must be taken to make explicit the implicit
                  semantics sometimes buried in the publisher's implementation of the document
                  type definition. By design, the NLM DTDs allow for a great deal of leeway in,
                  for example, declaring whether an element or attribute is required or optional, or
                  providing suggested rather than controlled lists for attribute values for such
                  things as a publication type, or suggesting but not enforcing the use of values as
                  defined in RFC 1766 for language codes in the
                  
                  <div class="code e217">xml:lang</div> attribute. For this and for other reasons,

                  for such things as publisher name or journal title; nor a single agreed-upon
                  format for publisher dates. Portico curates content with month values like
                  
                  <div class="quote e265">32</div>. This is not a case of

                  <div class="quote e267">month 32</div> is translated into a
                  generally-understood value. Again, however, that translation is an implicit
                  business rule, neither documented nor packaged with the document. Another
                  publisher provides no publication dates in the XML document; Portico constructed
                  an XML file to map from journal name/volume/issue to publication date, and
                  incorporates that information during transformation and curation. Another
                  publisher does not provide ISSN information in its XML source files; again,
                  Portico constructed an XML controlled list mapping from journal titles to ISSN

            <div class="para e285">Since Portico’s inception, there have been six minor (i.e. backwardly-compatible)
               and one major (non-backwardly-compatible) revision of the Portico XML archival unit
               metadata schema, in concert with a single non-backwardly-compatible extension of the
               content model of the objects comprising the archive. The major version change was
               made with a view toward enabling a richer set of content types, and more complex
               relationships among the components (text, images, supplemental files, versions of
               the same object, different manifestations of the same conceptual object) of those
               content types. Portico’s experience as it moved through the six minor versions was
               instructive when it came time to develop a schema that can be more flexibly extended
               with, for example, new event types from a controlled list. This flexibility comes
               at
               the reasonable price of a richer consistency enforcement mechanism than validation
               against a schema alone. Consistency in the case of the new metadata model is
               enforced via Schematron, which was also applied, along with schema validation, to
               metadata migrated from the version 1.x to version 2.0. The content model underlying
               the new schema, the data dictionary for the schema, the mapping from the 1.x to 2.0
               versions, as well as the mapping to analogous elements in METS and PREMIS, are all
               documented in detail.

            objects, the disciplined use of XML affords a reasonable solution to many of the issues
            associated with ensuring the interpretability and renderability of at least some digital
            artifacts – certainly for the first leg of the relay, and certainly for such artifacts

               Portico archive comprise over 176 million files, and fifteen terabytes, with nearly
               100 gigabytes of metadata for every terabyte of content. It required careful
               planning to scale up the Portico content preparation system from an initial capacity
               of roughly 75,000 archival units per month, to a capacity of 2,000,000 archival
               units per month – scaling that involved not just hardware and software, but

               bibliographic metadata, including search term generation and indexing, event
               metadata recording provenance information about the handling and processing of
               digital artifacts. Not just the quantity, but even the individual size of these

               JHOVE is stored in the Portico medatafile associated with each archival unit. This
               XML output can be quite large, and quite deeply nested. Portico has encountered
               output describing a technically valid PDF instance, which validates successfully

               associated bibliographic, technical, provenance and other event metadata map very
               well to XML. Some of the supplementary files accompanying journal articles, for
               example, such as HTML fragments, are amenable to conversion and preservation as XML.
               By and large, however, it is not at all clear that, apart from their metadata,

               (including many free and open source tools and libraries in a variety of languages),
               and a large community of practice. Many of the tools and libraries in particular
