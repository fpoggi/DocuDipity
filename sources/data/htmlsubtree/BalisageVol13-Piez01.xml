            <div class="para e8">LMNL provides a markup syntax for annotating arbitrary ranges, irrespective of

               syntax,
               if mapped) into a generalized data model, which can be queried and processed. Among
               the
               applications that LMNL supports readily is the creation of visual "sketches" of the
               markup
               on a document, e.g. using SVG. Such sketches can discover and depict any range relations
               of
               interest. It turns out the overlap is often less interesting than the hierarchies.

         <div class="title e19">LMNL experiments</div>
         <div class="para e20">As attendees of prior conferences in this series know, since 2002 I have been
            experimenting with an unorthodox approach to document markup, LMNL (the Layered Markup
            and
            Annotation Language), conceived by Jeni Tennison and myself with significant contributions
            and
            support by others. LMNL is similar to XML in its conceptual architecture, distinguishing
            between a markup syntax and a data model capturing an abstraction of 
            <div class="quote e21">text</div> as it
            is described by the syntax. Unlike XML, however, the LMNL data model represents arbitrary
            ranges over text; in particular, ranges that have any or no hierarchical relation
            to one
            another are as easily handled as those that fall into the familiar nested element
            structure of
            XML documents.
         </div>
         <div class="para e22">A simple example (five lines of a poem by Robert Frost) illustrates the syntax
            <div class="note e23">
               <div class="para e24">One reviewer recalls correctly that LMNL is defined as a data model, capable of
                  various syntactic representations. This is correct, but LMNL also has something we
                  called
                  
                  <div class="quote e25">LMNL syntax</div>, defined separately from the model and implementable in its
                  own right (inasmuch as it was a text-based format). Not everyone who built a LMNL
                  application has had occasion to use the syntax much; but my experiments with Luminescent
                  (
                  <div class="xref e26" linkend="Piez2012"></div>) show it is feasible in principle.
               </div>

                  antiquated documents archived at

               </div>
            </div> in its bare
            form:
            <div class="programlisting e29" xml:space="preserve">[sonnet}[octave}[s}[quatrain}[line}[phr}He would have said,{phr] [phr}and could himself

               [line}That the birds there in all the garden round{line]
               [line}Had gathered from the day-long voice of Eve{line]
               [line}And added to their own,{phr] [phr}an oversound,{phr]{line]{quatrain]
               [quatrain}[line}[phr}Her tone of meaning,{phr] [phr}though without the words.{phr]{line]{s]
               ...{quatrain]...{octave]...{sonnet]
            </div>
         </div>
         <div class="para e30">Interestingly, an approach to markup that permits arbitrary overlap, as does LMNL,
            turns
            out to be highly convenient for marking up multiple concurrent hierarchies (MCH),
            albeit with
            no built-in "awareness" of them in the model. (These hierarchies, that is, are entirely
            implicit in the data model until they are resolved and processed as hierarchies by
            a
            processor.) So, in the example just given, two concurrent hierarchies may be discerned
            in the
            poem. One hierarchy constitutes the formal structure of the sonnet as an example of
            English
            verse, in which (as represented here) lines are combined into couplets, tercets, quatrains,
            sestets, octaves—some of which may contain other such structures. (So an octave of
            eight lines
            may decompose into two quatrains of four lines each.) The other constitutes the structure
            of
            grammar and rhetoric (argument): phrases are joined to constitute sentences. Because
            sentences
            and indeed phrases may overlap verse structures, these two hierarchies do not align
            at every
            point. Yet they can nevertheless be discerned, separately or together, within the
            
            <div class="quote e31">range
               space
            </div> of the text.
         </div>
         <div class="para e32">MCH is readily visualized in a toolset able to process LMNL markup, build a range
            model
            from it, and generate an SVG diagram showing the ranges, as illustrated for this poem
            in 
            <div class="xref e33" linkend="BirdsAndEveGraph"></div>. Such a toolset was demonstrated at Balisage 2012 (
            <div class="xref e34" linkend="Piez2012"></div>).
            <div class="note e35">
               <div class="para e36">In case you are wondering, no claim is made that anything can be done here that cannot
                  be done in XML without LMNL. LMNL just makes it really really easy because we don't
                  have
                  to support XML-based workarounds for dealing with ranges, multiple hierarchies or
                  overlap.
                  In XML, we are faced with an XML (engineering) task even before we can get on with
                  the
                  markup task.

               the
               movement of the poem's language across its formal foundation.

         <div class="title e48">The reign of the OHCO</div>
         <div class="para e49">The acronym OHCO, for Ordered Hierarchy of Content Objects, was coined in 1990 to
            describe
            a tree-shaped data model for texts, or 
            <div class="quote e50">documents</div> (we set aside an examination
            of what these terms should mean here), in a seminal discussion of text encoding presented
            by
            Allen Renear and colleagues at Brown University (
            <div class="xref e51" linkend="Renear1990"></div>). The argument
            presented in that paper makes two claims: first, that a hierarchical model is superior
            to
            alternatives then prevalent for purposes of electronic document production and application,
            supporting necessary operations that are not so easily addressed by other data models
            then prevalent;
            <div class="note e52">
               <div class="para e53">Certainly this point of view has been vindicated; if we do not today speak much of
                  OHCOs, in our DOMs, trees, and directed acyclic graphs, we have infrastructures for
                  OHCO
                  under other names.
               </div>
            </div> and second, that this superiority is not merely pragmatic (an aspect of design and
            functionality), but due to the fact that such a model accurately reflects what a document
            actually 
            <div class="emphasis e54" role="ital">is</div> (as an abstraction, in the instance, or by
            definition). In the years since this argument was first made, its authors qualified
            and
            prevaricated to a degree (see, for example, 
            <div class="xref e55" linkend="Renear1993"></div>

                     <div class="para e57">Indeed, the 1993 consideration (
                        <div class="xref e58" linkend="Renear1993"></div>) of all the problems that
                        come with an overly-exclusive OHCO remains an excellent overview of the issues, twenty
                        years later. With apologies to DeRose, Durand and Mylonas, in this paper I may sometimes
                        refer to them mistakenly under the name

            </div>) in an effort to meet objections on several levels; but Renear, at least, has
            never given up the core metaphysical claim (for example, see 
            <div class="xref e60" linkend="Renear2004"></div>).
            Nor has he really had to, because, despite many objections, the first argument made
            by that
            paper has clearly carried the day (at least on the web), as SGML, XML, the HTML DOM
            and
            numerous other technologies have all verified the usefulness and power of the recursive,
            tree-shaped model. 
         </div>
         <div class="para e61">The OHCO thesis attributes three fundamental properties to texts, interdependent but
            distinct. First, a text is a hierarchy (the H in OHCO). Secondly, it is ordered (the
            O): we
            cannot simply take the constituent parts of a text (such as the lines in a sonnet
            by Robert
            Frost) and treat them as unordered, or re-order them, without altering (and thereby
            in some
            sense destroying) the text they make up together. Third (the CO), that these constituent
            parts
            all have 
            <div class="quote e62">thingness</div>: they too may be complex (ordered hierarchies of smaller
            objects); and in any case they have distinct properties or sets of properties—we might
            say
            they are 
            <div class="quote e63">typed</div>. So, although a system is not free to rearrange the objects that
            constitute a text, when it comes to objects of a given type (such as paragraphs, list
            items,
            or lists containing list items), we can treat them all alike. They are interchangeable,
            if not
            quite in the sense that one can be substituted for another, then at least insofar
            as they
            share essential properties that makes it both possible and correct to unify their
            handling in
            a system. This promises a satisfying power of generalization, since by this account,
            all
            sonnets can be handled alike, as can all their lines. Where there are exceptions to
            this, the
            system can and must account for them by subtyping or otherwise qualifying the types
            (so in XML
            we may assign attributes to elements to drive special handling) or by resolving differences
            based on their ordered, hierarchical relations (their 
            <div class="quote e64">context</div>). Thus, if some
            lines in a poem appear with extra vertical white space on the page, this is not because
            they
            are different, as lines, from others, but because the poem as a whole (or perhaps
            a
            constituent 
            <div class="quote e65">stanza</div> object) is displayed with extra spacing that belongs
            properly to it, not to its pieces.
         </div>
         <div class="para e66">Note that from the point of view of today's technologies, this powerful and elegant
            account of text as 
            <div class="emphasis e67" role="ital">system</div> and 
            <div class="emphasis e68" role="ital">organization</div> provides a rationale and justification for two things we have
            learned (since the thesis was proposed in 1990) to separate. On the one hand, in data
            models
            for XML, we have the ordered hierarchy. On the other, in the idea of a regulation
            and indeed a
            grammar of element types, we have a rationale for schemas. XML's parent standard,
            SGML,
            assumed that both were necessary together (in fact in SGML, the document's hierarchical
            form
            is arguably a side effect of the fact that it is specified with a grammar of element
            types).
            XML disentangles this dependency—its more consistent syntax maps to a hierarchy irrespective
            of element types and prescribed relations—and in doing so, acquires much greater flexibility
            in application. (This is not to say that XML is more expressive or capable of any
            application
            than SGML; only that because the XML parse can happen without reference to any schema
            or
            element specification, XML tools become more lightweight, easier to use and easier
            to build
            with than SGML tools.) Defining exactly what our content objects are and how they
            are to be
            treated may now be performed late, forgoing processes such as validation or data binding
            until
            they are known to be useful. Yet irrespective of the semantics of particular element
            types, an
            XML parser knows about elements and attributes, and can always present the hierarchy
            of
            elements for processing. So the tree remains: always there, always dependable, always
            addressable and processable using generic technologies designed for the purpose, such
            as
            XPath, XSLT and XQuery.
         </div>
         <div class="para e69">All of this was a very positive development for developers of publishing systems or
            data
            processing systems in general—and so, indirectly, for users and communities. Yet at
            the same
            time, handling 
            <div class="quote e70">overlap</div> in its various forms has remained a complication (at
            worst, a prohibitive one) for many applications of XML, especially applications whose
            purpose
            is not simply to create and process new texts or new versions of old texts (for example,
            in
            publishing activities), but to represent texts for scholarly or research purposes,
            as they are
            found, in all their complexity and nuance. The 
            <div class="emphasis e71" role="ital">retrospective</div>
            encoding of texts (see 
            <div class="xref e72" linkend="Piez2001"></div>) would offer encodings of documents that
            trace what we see in them, irrespective of any prior commitments to how these texts
            are (or
            should be) defined and constituted as texts—
            <div class="quote e73">the model of the text has the form of a
               tree
            </div> being such a prior commitment.
         </div>
         <div class="para e74">This hasn't stopped us from trying. To represent multiple concurrent hierarchies (MCH)
            in
            XML, or anything that doesn't fit into the hierarchy, we resort to one of several
            well-understood and well-documented workarounds: 
            <div class="quote e75">milestone</div> markers, chained
            segments, standoff markup or what have you (see 
            <div class="xref e76" linkend="Barnard1995"></div>, 
            <div class="xref e77" linkend="TEIch20"></div>). These work by specifying handling for particular elements or
            attributes, in order to represent, indirectly, things (not yet 
            <div class="quote e78">content objects</div>)
            that cut across the hierarchy. But this necessitates control of these elements'
            properties—identifiers and pointers to them—which indeed entails prior commitments
            to element
            semantics, as well as cumbersome and opaque methods of processing that are able to
            resolve
            these relations according to the kind of representation intended. This inevitably
            means we do
            not benefit much from schema-free processing, and face significant tagging and validation
            overhead just to represent the phenomena we seek to understand.
         </div>
         <div class="para e79">Thus a paradoxical consequence of XML's so-called 
            <div class="quote e80">overlap problem</div> is that
            it presents scholars and researchers with a special challenge precisely as we seek
            to study
            the place, nature and historical development of hierarchies in text. We who are most
            fascinated by the OHCO thesis, and wish most to scrutinize the nature of hierarchies
            in texts,
            are the most hampered by a data model that imposes a single hierarchy, because we
            have
            questions not readily addressed when it must be assumed. Because document hierarchies
            provide
            XML tools with their frames of reference (literally), it is difficult to consider
            the
            hierarchy of a text, while using XML, as anything but given: using XML to consider
            how the
            OHCO thesis applies to text is like looking at a rose garden through rose-colored
            glasses.
            (The world may look nice, but we can only smell, not see, the roses.)
         </div>
         <div class="para e81">In particular, it becomes difficult to ask questions, using XML encoding, about texts
            whose hierarchies that are not perfectly regular, or about the relation of multiple
            hierarchies (
            <div class="quote e82">views</div> according to 
            <div class="xref e83" linkend="Renear1993"></div>) that appear
            together. Are their relations incidental, or systematic and significant? What accounts
            for the
            structural regularity of texts? Does a single account serve for all texts, or do various
            kinds, genres, or formats of text show different aspects (features, hierarchies) that
            suggest
            or demand different explanations? Accepting Renear's argument that the OHCO is a 
            <div class="quote e84">real
               thing
            </div>, where does it come from and how did it come about? Are texts produced before
            the electronic age, as Renear and his colleagues argued, also always ordered hierarchies,
            and
            do they always have content objects? If so, of what nature are these? With their tree-shaped
            document models, do XML and HTML represent a radical break from prior forms of text,
            or are
            they a continuity? And if they are a continuity, what do they continue?
         </div>
         <div class="para e85">One of the most fascinating things about this inquiry is that it is greatly facilitated
            by
            a technology, such as LMNL, that allows us to mark up and process text without imposing
            hierarchy at all. Where we can have any hierarchy or none, hierarchy itself is immediately
            open for study.

         <div class="title e87">Ironies of alignment</div>
         <div class="para e88">As illustrated above, it is perfectly possible to discern more than one hierarchy
            in, say,
            an example of poetry, where we have both formal organization (stanza and line) and
            grammatical
            structure (sentences and phrases) together. By definition, by distinguishing more
            than one
            hierarchy, we admit the potential for them to conflict or overlap. (If they were never
            in
            conflict, then we should be able to accommodate them together within a single hierarchy.)
            And
            indeed examples of poetry are not hard to find in which there is not perfect alignment

            The
            earlier, more 
            <div class="quote e106">classical</div> example shows a perfect alignment between meter and
            grammatical structure (one does not need to be a reader of German to see this); the
            latter
            poem, anything but.
         </div>
         <div class="para e107">In each poem, the degree of alignment between these two hierarchies is significant,
            and
            thematic. Indeed, in each poem, this aspect (especially when we take grammatical structure
            as
            a proxy for phrasing when read aloud) is integral to the sense of the poem itself,
            reflecting
            and reinforcing its denotation. Both these sonnets, like many sonnets, are about sonnets.
            Goethe's is a reflection on the art of crafting verse, among other arts, while in
            Rilke's,
            both the tree of the first line, and the temple it has become in the last, represent
            the
            singing of Orpheus and thus poetry itself. Goethe's poem might be described as
            
            <div class="quote e108">rectilinear</div> and balanced throughout, while Rilke's shows a kind of eddying
            movement that enacts a transition (weaves a spell, we might say) like the one it describes.
            In
            other words, we have here a kind of signification: in both cases, whether, how much
            and where
            the sentence structure aligns with the verse, and where it fails to, is part of the
            poetry
            itself. It says something. Nor are these two examples at all unusual in this, as a
            consideration of a broader selection can show.

         <div class="para e109">We might generalize from this to consider what happens when multiple concurrent

            two
            simultaneous arrangements might coincide, but do not—is 
            <div class="emphasis e110" role="ital">irony</div>. Of course, 
            <div class="quote e111">irony</div> designates a rhetorical trope (a figure of
            speech or signification) in which the meaning being overtly represented is not the
            same as the
            meaning being communicated.
            <div class="note e112">
               <div class="para e113">One reviewer asked whether this definition of 
                  <div class="citation e114">irony</div> wasn’t too
                  broad (so weak as not to disinguish irony from other tropes), and I admit that for
                  me
                  almost any trope has ironic potential or capability. But I would contrast irony with
                  metaphor (for example) in indicating how irony works by a deliberate 
                  <div class="emphasis e115" role="ital">failure</div> of alignment, whereas metaphor works through the alignment itself.
                  In any case, these are excellent questions.
               </div>
            </div> More generally, it is a signal, by means of a kind of misalignment or variance from
            expectation, that a meaning should not be taken (at least by a knowing audience) at
            face
            value; the representation must not only be looked 
            <div class="quote e116">at</div>, but also looked
            
            <div class="quote e117">through</div>, with the understanding that what is seen at the different levels may
            not correspond (and that this failure to correspond can itself tell us something).
            By this
            account, Goethe is not being ironic in his assertion that 
            <div class="quote e118">only law can give us
               freedom
            </div>, and he demonstrates the principle he enunciates.
            <div class="note e119">
               <div class="para e120">At least one reviewer appeared to be under a misconception that I am disparaging what
                  is not ironic in favor of the ironic, that Goethe’s work somehow suffers in comparison
                  to
                  Rilke's. Nothing could be further from the truth, and to say Goethe’s sonnet is not
                  ironic
                  (at least with respect to this particular kind of internal structural alignment between
                  sound and form) is not to say that it is not self-conscious (as it certainly is) in
                  other
                  ways, for example metaphorically or metonymically. Indeed it might be said that Goethe’s
                  
                  <div class="emphasis e121" role="ital">synecdoche</div> here (synecdoche being the 
                  <div class="quote e122">part for
                     whole
                  </div> trope) is deliberately and consciously 
                  <div class="emphasis e123" role="ital">not</div> ironic—and that Rilke’s irony would have been impossible without
                  it.
               </div>
            </div> But Rilke's verse is ironic: this poem also follows all applicable rules of
            versification, while at the same time it threatens (or pretends to threaten) to transgress
            the
            sonnet's strict boundaries in its act of creation. The poem speaks with two voices
            at once, in
            tension until its end, exuberantly about to burst out of itself at any moment. As
            readers, we
            are invited to notice this.
         </div>
         <div class="para e124">I believe that instances like this have much to teach us about the way texts communicate
            and indeed about the ways in which literary and documentary forms of text serve their
            purposes. Even to characterize it this way gives us an opportunity to see an important
            distinction, if we can generalize to say that 
            <div class="quote e125">literary</div> texts are characterized
            by the capacity for this kind of irony (an irony that may confirm or deepen evident
            senses
            even while it may superficially undermine them), while 
            <div class="quote e126">documentary</div> may describe
            that class of texts in which this kind of variance does not happen or is not supposed
            to. (We
            do not want aircraft maintenance manuals, scientific reports, or maybe even conference
            papers
            to present such problems for their readers. This is to say nothing in disparagement
            of texts
            that show little or no ironic transgression of their own forms: they have their own
            strengths
            and virtues.) If so, this might help explain why an OHCO model is so well suited for
            so much
            work in publishing and data processing (in which such misalignments within organizations
            of
            text must be erased or elided lest their complications destabilize regular operations),
            especially for 
            <div class="quote e127">born-digital</div> materials (which can be made to conform to these
            constraints in their creation)—while at the same time, a model that imposes a single
            hierarchy
            can be so frustratingly inept for other purposes, even including the study and representation
            of (something called)

         <div class="para e131">Other examples of overlap in literary texts give rise to similar questions, while
            continuing to suggest that such ironies and misalignments are not always bugs, but
            features,
            indeed essential ones. Of particular interest to students of literature, for example,
            are the
            structures of formal narrative. Necessarily, as soon as these conflict with logical
            and
            presentational arrangements (such as chapters and paragraphs, which may normally fail
            to align
            with narrative and dialogue), a model such as XML's, which reflects a simple OHCO,
            forces us
            to foreground one or the other hierarchy, while likewise inhibiting our ability to
            see how
            they work together despite (and because of) their tensions, because whichever hierarchy
            we
            push into the background is not easily or immediately recognizable as a hierarchy.
         </div>
         <div class="para e132">One vivid example of such a text is Mary Shelley's novel of 1818, 
            <div class="emphasis e133" role="ital">Frankenstein, or, the Modern Prometheus</div> (revised 1831). A canonical example of
            the Gothic genre, it shows a set of anomalies that are both interestingly illustrative
            for
            this text, and yet also suggestive of issues for any such text.
         </div>
         <div class="para e134">We will follow the lead of the 1993 revised statement regarding OHCO (
            <div class="xref e135" linkend="Renear1993"></div>) in suggesting that any adequate accounting for what the text
            
            <div class="quote e136">is</div> must correspond at least generally with our intuitions. A very simple
            intuition is that a text (at any rate, a text of the nineteenth century) is going
            to be a
            sequence of printed (or manuscript) pages; and indeed, one of the first things we
            find we can
            do using LMNL is mark, as ranges named 
            <div class="code e137">page</div>, the extents of pages of the novel in
            whatever edition(s) we choose (in this case, the revised edition of 1831, which is
            the version
            known to most readers), and not only (as is more usual in XML) their starting points.
            The fact
            that pages may overlap with paragraphs and chapters is not a problem when using a
            markup
            regime that imposes no containment. And if such a concept of text is evidently too
            unsophisticated to take us far, that's okay too: since the markup technology permits
            it, we
            can proceed to mark the pages as ranges (not only insert markers for the page breaks)
            If the
            page hierarchy is interesting (as it may be to students of printed media and their
            history),
            that is enough. Or even only useful, because it allows us readily to retrieve pages
            in the
            edition (see 
            <div class="xref e138" linkend="LuminescentQueries"></div>). In any case, marking up pages in addition
            to anything else is easy and straightforward, without concern for whether hierarchies
            will
            inhibit the markup of other features we expect to see on a closer look. We don't have
            to
            invent, then test and enforce, any special schemes or implicit processing logic to
            accomplish
            this, resolving the actual 
            <div class="quote e139">pages</div>, with their content, and not just breaks
            between them.
         </div>
         <div class="para e140">Of course the ordered hierarchy we will usually prefer will be that of of chapters
            and
            paragraphs. Yet in this novel, these are not quite adequate for a comprehensive account.
            Not
            only are there an Introduction and a Preface (assuming we consider them to be part
            of
            
            <div class="quote e141">the text</div>, we can think of them to be specialized chapters if we like), but
            also, we find the chapters of the novel do not account for its entirety. (See 
            <div class="xref e142" linkend="ChaptersOnly"></div>). Before the chapters begin we are presented with a framing
            narrative, consisting of letters, one of which (the last) contains several entries,
            in the
            midst of one of which, the sequence of chapters begins. So the 
            <div class="quote e143">logical</div> view is
            deeper than most modern novels, having an epistolary form wrapped around the primary
            narrative—the sort of complication that is not unusual in the Gothic genre. A

         <div class="para e189">Mapping out narrative boundaries has always been one of the challenges of OHCO-based
            models, if not because narrative fails at being well structured (typically it does
            not), then
            because they so often conflict with the 
            <div class="quote e190">logical</div> structures of paragraphs and
            sections or chapters—the 
            <div class="quote e191">published view</div>. As long as the range space was
            occupied by one and one hierarchy only (that is, as long as the data model recognized
            only a
            single hierarchy), and as long as the (so-called) logical hierarchy of the published
            view was
            given pride of place, it has been more or less prohibitively difficult to use XML
            to mark up
            any hierarchy (or indeed any phenomena at all) that overlapped chapters and paragraphs.
            Paradoxically, the ideology that 
            <div class="quote e192">descriptive</div> markup should serve multiple
            purposes, and not be limited to presentation (see 
            <div class="xref e193" linkend="Coombs1987"></div>, 
            <div class="xref e194" linkend="Renear2004"></div>), may have hindered this also, since there is at least a presumption
            that one should be able to mark up paragraphs and chapters, and yet also mark up everything
            else one might wish to describe. (Because text, by definition, is an OHCO, there will
            
            <div class="emphasis e195" role="ital">ipso facto</div> never be a conflict between the so-called
            
            <div class="quote e196">logical</div> structure and anything else that is 
            <div class="quote e197">really there</div>.) In
            other words, the XML data model interferes with the realization of a regime of descriptive
            markup that is fully adequate to the principle's potential. The range model offered
            by LMNL
            presents no such difficulties: using LMNL syntax, marking these hierarchies together
            is only
            as difficult as marking each separately.
         </div>
         <div class="para e198">Yet at the same time, there does seem to be a stress between these hierarchies that
            we do
            not feel, for example, from the misalignment of either of them with the pagination.
            We do not
            expect pagination to align with anything, regarding it as an incidental consequence
            of
            typesetting, not a reflection of 
            <div class="quote e199">the text</div>. Accordingly, we are tempted to set
            aside the pagination structure as merely incidental to anything else (at least until
            it turns
            out there is some sort of echoing or consonance). Yet between the narrative and the
            published
            view (the chapters and paragraphs)—most particularly, since the published view must
            include
            (for this novel) the letters and entries that 
            <div class="quote e200">wrap</div> the chapter sequence (except
            where they don't)—the reader faces a similar kind of phenomenogical stress as we have
            observed
            in poetry. Is there an irony here, serving any sort of purpose (or creating any sort
            of
            effect) like the effect of sentences and phrases in poetry pushing and pulling against
            verse
            lines? Apparently there is, if we consider how our attention hardly shifts, as readers,
            across
            the boundary in Chapter 24, back out to the framing narrative in which it is embedded,
            like
            waking up from a nightmare—only to discover it is not a dream, when the monstrous
            creature at
            the center of the tale next appears on the scene, no longer only hearsay, but breathing,
            speaking, imprecating. (Or so the story says.)
         </div>
         <div class="para e201">Thus we are brought back to the text. (Really.) Examining the boundaries between chapters
            (the published view) and the entries in the letters that contain them shows us how
            we get into
            this trouble in the first place—because the rendering of these transitions in this
            edition (as
            seen in 
            <div class="xref e202" linkend="pages1831"></div>) leaves it somewhat doubtful that the reader will easily
            construe exactly how things are set up—at least as long as she or he is shaking herself
            awake.
            Indeed, we are inclined to ask, shouldn't Chapter 24 really end on page 188, with
            
            <div class="quote e203">Walton, in continuation</div>? The reader must be the judge. Interestingly, to the
            extent I have been able to determine the question by looking at various editions of
            this
            frequently-reprinted novel, the 1831 revision by Mary Shelley is actually ambiguous
            on this
            point, there being no page headers or other indicators to suggest that we are still
            inside
            Chapter 24 as the framing narrative resumes. Yet in almost every subsequent edition
            I have
            been able to find,

            <div class="quote e221">inside</div> Chapter 24 is an error or lapse, and that the correct form of the

               <div class="para e223">Since this paper was first drafted, I have learned more about the textual transmission
                  of Frankenstein, which complicates this picture significantly, without substantially
                  challenging the argument here. In the original 1818 edition, indeed, the chapters
                  (along
                  with the framing narrative) are grouped into volumes. Yet the same question arises
                  as to
                  whether the final passages (entries in Walton's letter from August 26 - September
                  12)
                  should be included within the last chapter (Chapter VII) of Volume III. Considering
                  them
                  as external to it does 
                  <div class="quote e224">regularize</div> the shape of the novel along similar
                  lines to what I have discussed as applying to the structure of 1831—indeed with an
                  added
                  dimension, since the tripartite division into volumes reflects the tripartite division
                  of
                  Victor's narrative (while it does not entirely correspond with, inasmuch as it must
                  also
                  comprise the leading and trailing sections). Moreover, manuscript evidence that a
                  two-volume structure was subsequently recast into three volumes suggests that the
                  eventual
                  three-volume structure (which neatly corresponds to the clean nesting of a
                  
                  <div class="quote e225">corrected</div> 1831 text) was a design decision on the part of the author. See
                  Robinson (email) 2014, Robinson 1996, SGA [date], and Hindle 1992. Additionally, a
                  set of
                  invaluable resources for studying the textual history of the novel is at the Shelley

            is
            somewhat misleading—into a single ordered hierarchy. The novel is comprised of four
            letters,

            of an evolution in media and forms of expression, and in this case only imperfectly
            realized
            or expressed in the printed medium. We do not have to regard the relation between
            the
            narrative structure and the formal chapter/paragraph organization as 
            <div class="quote e248">ironic</div>;

            such as
            between Walton's narrative and Victor's contained narrative—which we might also see.
            Rather,
            it is in the alignment of the structure of the narrative as a set of attested
            
            <div class="quote e249">documents</div> (including Walton's letters and his transcript of Victor's story

            (chapter/paragraph) form.
         </div>
         <div class="para e252">Yet to argue that the correct reading is that these must be aligned, with no possibility
            of intentional misarrangement, as a consequence of what it is to be a text, 
            <div class="quote e253">because ...
               OHCO
            </div> (which is not, mind you, what was ever proposed for OHCO ... it’s just that
            somehow this coincided with the push for SGML, then to be wired into XML), is to suppose
            we
            know the answer before we have pondered the question. Instead, alerted to the possibility
            that
            this novel (and others) might well perturb, if not altogether defy, its own well-ordered
            arrangement—the possibility, that is, of an ironic stress between two or more of its
            internal
            and presented structures—the fact that we can reconcile them here becomes important.
            If this
            novel is an ordered hierarchy, an arrangement of nested narratives (that happens incidentally
            to be segmented, in part, into chapters), it is a 
            <div class="emphasis e254" role="ital">particular</div>
            ordered hierarchy of particular content objects. Even the possibility of this reading,
            that
            is, vindicates the idea that such a model (which indeed is satisfyingly symmetrical
            in this
            case) was indeed part of the concept of the novel itself. The novel is structured
            as it is not
            because of some prior rule that texts are always hierarchies, but because Mary Shelley
            designed it like this. (She put the hierarchy there much in the way an XML schema
            designer
            would have. Except that typesetters subsequently failed to understand her full intent,
            or the
            implication of it.) At the same time, were the typographer to do a better job representing
            the
            shift back to the framing story when Frankenstein's narrative ends, it would make
            it no less
            startling (indeed, maybe more so) when the creature himself appears on the scene—by
            this
            reading, 
            <div class="emphasis e255" role="ital">outside</div> the chapters of the book. A boundary is
            transgressed in either case; indeed in this reading even more strongly, since the
            separation
            of the framing narrative indicated by a clean ending to Chapter 24 is suddenly broken,
            and we,
            with the narrator, are brought face to face with something we would prefer never to
            have
            met.Likewise we can see how our vindication of an OHCO here is only provisional: it
            applies to
            this novel alone (as long as we take the paginated structure to be incidental, and
            leave aside
            the occasional misalignment of dialogue speeches with paragraphs), and is liable to
            slip with
            any new example of a narrative that violates it.
         </div>
         <div class="para e256">In this respect Frankenstein is not singular among works of literature. Meanwhile,
            the
