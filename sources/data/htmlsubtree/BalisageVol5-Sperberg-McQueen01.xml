            Like most folktales, the story of 
            <div class="emphasis e25">Stone Soup</div>
            circulates in a variety of forms.  Some of you will have heard it in
            one form, some in another; some of you may never have heard it or not
            recognize it under this name.  For those of you keeping score at home,
            you will want to know this is number 1548 in the Aarne-Thompson system
            of folktale classification.  The version of the story that I have in
            mind goes something like this.
            
         </div>
         <div class="para e26">
            It's the end of a long war.  Three destitute soldiers are making their
            way through a war-ravaged landscape, trying to get home, struggling
            against hunger and fatigue and suspicious villagers.  They are
            benighted in a remote place, and they find a village as it is getting
            late afternoon or early evening, and they knock on a door and ask for
            food.  The master of the house tells them, 
            <div class="quote e27">No, we don't have enough
               food to share with anybody,
            </div> and slams the door in their faces.
            
            
         </div>
         <div class="para e28">
            They go to the next house, same story.  They go through all the houses
            in the village; no one has enough food to be willing to share with
            strangers.  So they go to the central place of the village, and they
            pull out a pot, and they go out to the nearby forest, and they gather
            some wood, and they make a fire.  And one of them comes in, bringing a
            large stone, and he puts it in the pot.  And they go out to the
            stream, and they draw water, and they fill the pot with water, and
            they start making the motions of cooking.  
            
         </div>
         <div class="para e29">
            The villagers are of course watching them from behind curtains and
            shutters, and eventually one of the villagers goes out and asks them
            what they're doing.  And they say, 
            <div class="quote e30">Well, we're making stone soup.
               You know, it's not ideal soup, but it's good to have when three is
               nothing else to be had.  Actually, sometimes it tastes pretty good,
               although at the moment this one could use some more salt.
            </div>  
            
         </div>
         <div class="para e31">
            And the villager says, 
            <div class="quote e32">You make stone soup?</div>
            
         </div>
         <div class="para e33">
            They say, 
            <div class="quote e34">Yeah. It's, you know, something you learn in the
               army.
            </div>
            
         </div>
         <div class="para e35">
            And he's curious enough that he says, 
            <div class="quote e36">Well, I have some salt.</div>
            So he gives them some salt, and they salt the water, and they say,
            
            <div class="quote e37">Yeah, that's better.</div>
            
         </div>
         <div class="para e38">
            And a few more minutes go by, and they explain that this takes a
            while.  And then one of them pronounces, 
            <div class="quote e39">Oh, gosh, it would be nice
               to have some pepper.
            </div>
            
         </div>
         <div class="para e40">
            Well, the first villager doesn't have any pepper, but he has a
            neighbor who does, and he goes and fetches that neighbor, and they add
            the pepper.  And you can ... of course, the storyteller can spin this
            next bit out indefinitely.  Since some of you have planes to catch, I
            won't.  I'll just — you can imagine some onions, some leeks or
            chives, maybe some carrots, some meal — some oatmeal or flour — to
            thicken, potatoes, eventually some beef, and by the end of the, by the
            end of a certain amount of time all of the villagers are out cooking
            soup together and having a wonderful evening because when they share,
            they do have enough.

         <div class="title e42"></div>
         <div class="para e43">
            Now, it seems to me that this story of stone soup may illuminate our
            situation possibly in more than one way.  Most obviously, of course,
            it describes a situation of limited resources, of reduced
            circumstances which may feel familiar to a lot of people from the last
            couple of years, given the situation of the world economy and the
            national economies of the various countries where most of us live.
            All of you will be aware that there are lot of people who are feeling
            rather straitened in their circumstances and wondering how to make do
            with less.
            
         </div>
         <div class="para e44">
            Of course, making do with less, lowering resource consumption,
            re-using existing resources — that, of course, has been a
            standard injunction to system designers and implementors for years.
            
            <div class="quote e45">Don't re-invent the wheel!  Don't waste resources by unnecessary
               duplication.  Re-use.  Share.
            </div>
            
         </div>
         <div class="para e46">
            If there is anyone who ought to feel comfortable in a world of acute
            attention to careful use of resources, it ought to be people using
            descriptive markup.  The principle of thrift that is embedded in the
            idea of re-use, the principle of openness embedded in the idea of
            information sharing, were, after all, the original motives for the
            development of descriptive markup in the first place as embodied in
            SGML and later in XML and still later in experimental languages like
            TexMecs and LMNL and Freestyle Markup Language and so forth.  
            <div class="emphasis e47">Stone soup</div> could almost be the official folktale of
            the descriptive markup community.
            
         </div>
         <div class="para e48">
            Now, of course, a lot of things change.  But as Eric Freese showed us
            on the first day [
            <div class="xref e49" linkend="Freese"></div>], the idea of
            re-use — of sharing — in the form of single-source
            publishing to multiple targets is still alive and well and living
            today on mobile devices.
         </div>
         <div class="para e50">
            But, of course, you don't always have the markup that you would like.
            In Eric's case, the main problem was he had markup that captured
            information he wasn't interested in so his first problem was to clear
            out markup he had no use for.  Frequently, of course, we have too
            little information or the wrong kind of information.  Or the title of
            the video game has been replaced by a digital image, and you have no
            textual access to it.
            
         </div>
         <div class="para e51">
            Intelligent use of what you have has always been part of the story of
            descriptive markup.  One of my favorite histories in this regard took
            place a few years ago in the Perseus Project, which is now based at
            Tufts University.

            The Perseus Project sent these offshore to be keyboarded, and of
            course, the keyboardists were not classical philologists, so they were
            keying in what were to them opaque strings.  And the most you can
            expect in a situation like that is a fairly careful typographic
            markup.  So they get digitized texts of the dictionaries back, but,
            you know, what you have marked is

            But, of course, the Perseus Project is not limited to short-term
            results.  They've been around for awhile.  They expect to be around
            awhile, and they are, of course, dealing with data whose average age
            is a little more than 2,000 years, so they're not impatient people.
            So, the first thing they did was make a stylesheet so they could
            display dictionary entries in their browser.  Entry boundaries were,
            of course, marked in the data they had so that was fairly easy; you
            could look up a word and look at the dictionary entry.

            Now, Greg Crane was from an early age known a regex wizard (he's a
            fanatical user of lex — not yacc, just lex). He noticed, 
            <div class="quote e70">You
               know, there's an interesting thing here. Arabic numerals occur in
               exactly two positions in an average article in Greek-English
               dictionaries.   It is either the book and section number of a citation
               and is immediately followed by Greek characters, or it's a sense
               number in which case it's immediately followed by a Latin character
               because glosses are given in English.
            </div>  And armed with this
            information — most of you could write the appropriate regular
            expression already — armed with this information, he was able to
            identify the major sense boundaries in the articles of the dictionary.
            And as he pointed out, it was at that moment — six weeks after
            they got the digitized data, not six years — that the digital
            object became more useful for almost every purpose than the paper
            object because they could insert blank lines between the senses and it
            became much easier to get an overview of long and complicated
            articles.  If you have ever studied dead languages with dictionaries
            built by philologists whose attention to detail is, shall we say,
            fabled in the academic world, you know that a long dictionary entry
            may go on for column after column after column and because space is at
            a premium on the page, there is no typographic marking.  You have to
            pay attention to the numbers.  But because space is not at such a
            premium on the screen — pixels are free in ways that paper is
            not — they were able to make it visually easier to track the
            structure of articles.  And at that point, almost everybody in the
            Perseus Project preferred to look up words in the electronic version
            rather than the paper version because it was easier to use.

            One of the reasons I liked the paper by Stefanie Haupt and Maik
            Stührenberg the other day is that it illustrates the same kind of
            thing [

            It has always been a challenge to find ways to do
            up-translation, but the key remains the same:  Know your data; exploit
            that knowledge.  Knowing that even if the title on the main review has
            been replaced by an image, you can probably find it by following a
            link and then looking for the back link, that requires knowledge of
            data.  Exploiting that knowledge makes possible an up-translation that
            might otherwise have looked impossible.  Know your data.

            Economic poverty comes in at least two different forms.  Some people
            are poor because they have no choice.  But in many cultures, there are
            those who embrace economic poverty willingly, often for religious or,
            more generally, spiritual reasons.  Here in primarily Catholic Quebec,
            monasticism comes to mind.  Intellectually there seems to be an
            analogous kind of choice or move made by those who focus their
            attention on a small number of fundamental objects or questions.  And
            one of the big themes for me of this year's Balisage has definitely
            been the very prominent thread of focus on fundamentals and on
            foundations in two rather different flavors; first, there are
            foundational questions and foundational, intellectual topics.  I think
            here of Mario Mario Blažević's work exploiting the
            relation of marked-up documents to their underlying document grammars
            [
            <div class="xref e74" linkend="Blažević"></div>], or more abstractly,
            the work by Maik Stührenberg and Christian Wurm on the expressive
            power of document grammars [
            <div class="xref e75" linkend="Stührenberg"></div>] — important work in the service of keeping our
            intellectual foundations in good order.

         <div class="para e76">
            Of course, one of the other intellectual foundational questions that
            has always occupied this conference and its predecessors — the
            problem of overlap — was also well-represented this year.  Piotr
            Banski's work on stand-off annotation [
            <div class="xref e77" linkend="Bański"></div>], and Pondorf and Witt's work on the Freestyle Markup
            Language [
            <div class="xref e78" linkend="Pondorf"></div>]
            help to keep that thread of Balisage papers alive.

            But most visible in this area of fundamental concepts, I think, are
            the various papers on this and that aspect of semantics.  The work by
            Quinn and Andrew Dombrowski in the pre-conference's symposium applying
            Montague semantics to the question of vocabulary choice for
            institutions that aim at long-term preservation of 
            data [

            The work done by my colleagues, Claus Huitfeldt and Yves Marcoux, on
            the applicability of Peirce's type/token distinction to markup
            languages also fits here [
            <div class="xref e82" linkend="Huitfeldt"></div>].  
            Ann Wrightson's persistent effort to place
            the questions of markup semantics on a firmer foundation, beginning
            with the natural and not always easy task of identifying, as she tried
            to do in her nocturne, exactly what the questions are.

            But there's another kind of foundation that's been, I think, more
            visible than usual at this year's Balisage.  If you wanted to redo the
            foundations of a lot of our work, you would have to spend time
            improving the situation of XML processing in our programming language
            libraries and improving the tools that we use to build applications
            for our customers, so you might want to have, say, somebody smart
            working on a better API to tree representations so that you weren't
            locked in to this or that tree model the moment you wrote an XML
            application.  So you might want exactly what Amelia Lewis and Eric
            Johnson gave us early in the conference with their work on 
            gXML [
            <div class="xref e90" linkend="Lewis"></div>].  
            You might want to be able to build a full XML application as far as
            possible in the browser, so you would want surely an XProc processor
            in the browser of, gee, pretty much exactly the kind that 
            Vojtěch Toman presented to us [
            <div class="xref e91" linkend="Toman"></div>]; good luck on getting that 
            last 17% done.
            Cyril
            Briquet similarly reported on software for making it easier to process
            large XML-encoded corpora [
            <div class="xref e92" linkend="Briquet"></div>].  
            Wendell Piez emerged victorious from the
            demo jam, demonstrating software using XML-based infrastructure to
            process and visualize overlap.
            Mary Holstege's work on schema
            analytics [

            of those fit here as does Hugh Cayless' work showing us how to
            implement the kind of string-range function that we have in many of
            our vocabularies been assuming and wanting for a long time even though
            the implementations were not there.  Fortunately, we have some hope
            that when we finally put our foot down in that direction and move
            forward, Hugh and his colleague will have put some ground underneath
            it [

            The second aspect of the stone soup story that strikes me though, one
            is that the soup is like an agile product; it goes through a number of
            iterations.  And the first one really doesn't have a very close
            resemblance to the last; it starts out as hot water, and it ends up as
            soup or stew.  And the idea of getting something done — getting
            something out — and iterating again and again and again as many
            times as it takes is also one that is useful to take to heart.  It
            reminds me, in a way that I'm not sure I fully understand, of Richard

            bore you with  stuff you've already heard, so I need a show of hands:
            How many of you don't know Richard Gabriel's essay which circulates on
            the web under the title

            gosh.  Now, sorry, just to make sure we have the right polarity, I was
            asking for the people who don't know it.  Okay, well, in that case,
            I'm going to read you a lengthy quotation from Richard Gabriel; I will
            not attempt to project it and let you read it silently because you
            read at different speeds; this way we all end up together.  Gabriel is
            talking about the state of LISP processors; this is 1991.  He is
            talking at a LISP users conference, and he pauses to compare and

                     using the New Jersey approach. C is therefore a language for which it
                     is easy to write a decent compiler, and it requires the programmer to
                     write text that is easy for the compiler to interpret. Some have
                     called C a fancy assembly language. Both early Unix and C compilers
                     had simple structures, are easy to port, require few machine resources
                     to run, and provide about 50%-80% of what you want from an operating
                     system and programming language.

                     philosophy means that implementation simplicity has highest priority,
                     which means Unix and C are easy to port on such machines. Therefore,
                     one expects that if the 50% functionality Unix and C support is

                     A further benefit of the worse-is-better philosophy is that the
                     programmer is conditioned to sacrifice some safety, convenience, and
                     hassle to get good performance and modest resource use. Programs
                     written using the New Jersey approach will work well both in small
                     machines and large ones, and the code will be portable because it is
                     written on top of a virus.

                     It is important to remember that the initial virus has to be basically
                     good. If so, the viral spread is assured as long as it is
                     portable. Once the virus has spread, there will be pressure to improve
                     it, possibly by increasing its functionality closer to 90%, but users
                     have already been conditioned to accept worse than the right
                     thing. Therefore, the worse-is-better software first will gain
                     acceptance, second will condition its users to expect less, and third
                     will be improved to a point that is almost the right thing. In
                     concrete terms, even though Lisp compilers in 1987 were about as good
                     as C compilers, there are many more compiler experts who want to make
                     C compilers better than want to make Lisp compilers better.

            1.0 implementations of XSLT.  And that development of XSLT seems to me
            to illustrate very nicely the progress you can make if you start with
            something relatively small, relatively simple, but basically good, and
            gradually, incrementally improve it.

            by everyone working together.  The stone doesn't create it either; it
            catalyzes it, together with the story told by the soldiers.  There is

            I wish there were more, and I wish the coverage were
            broader, but it's not an impossible task.  It just requires commitment
            and organization and hard work and probably some money along the way,
            but that's by the by.  And directly connected with that, but pointing
            back to the fundamental questions with which we began, recall the
            paper on XML essence testing in which Abraham Becker and Jeff Beck
            showed us that asking what things are in essence, which looks awfully
            theoretical and foundational in many respects, can have important
            practical implications for database management or data 
            management [

            How to use technology in applications is in some sense a purely
            intellectual and technical question, but it's also a social question.
            How do we propogate the relevant knowledge and ensure that it's
            accessible to the developers who need it?  And it's here that design
            patterns seem to me to fit together with the talks that we've just
            heard this morning from William Candillon and his colleagues on XQuery
            design patterns [
            <div class="xref e178" linkend="Candillon"></div>], and from Ann

            for XML vocabulary design of the shift in processor architectures
            that's taking place under our feet. (Implications which may or may not
            apply; see previous discussion.)

            So the story of stone soup seems to me to illustrate three lessons we
            can usefully keep in mind.  Make the most of what you have.  Second,
            iterate. Start simple and then keep trying; don't let the best be the
            enemy of the good. But also and contrarily — this is the way
            proverbs always are — prepare for future growth; prepare for
            change.  Try to avoid getting locked into a particular technology or
            version of your technology forever for backward compatibility reasons,
            i.e., don't let the good be the enemy of the best.  Work for a path
            where you can get the good now and get the best, or at least better,
            later.  Third, work together.  The kind of information we want to
            collect, manage, and preserve is for the most part social,
            organizational, and cultural information.  Even when it's purely
            scientific data, even when it's the mass spectrometer data, the reason
            that we want it and the way that we exploit it are given partly by our
            cultural organizations.  It arises from and has meaning primarily, or
            exclusively in some cases, in the social context; don't leave that
            social context out of account.
            
         </div>
         <div class="para e181">
            One way to make the most of what you have, of course, is to learn by
            talking to other people and by attending conferences like, for
            instance, Balisage.  One way to iterate is to do so on a schedule, to
            do things again and again at regular intervals like, for example,
            annually, like Balisage.  One way to remember the social context is to
            remember that you are part of it and to make yourself actively a part
            of it, for example, by gathering together with people with whom you
            share interests, for example, at Balisage.  So, one moral of the stone
            soup story is attend Balisage in Montreal!  Of course, you already
            knew that.  Some of the best stories remind us of things we already
            know.  Now, on Monday or Tuesday I remember standing up here and
            saying how glad I was to see so many unfamiliar faces in the audience,
            and I'm equally happy today to see how many of those faces have become
            familiar, now representing friends I hope to see at future occurrences
            of this conference.  Some of them I haven't managed to talk to as much
            as I would like, which just means you also have to come back next year
            so we can try again.  Thank you for coming to Balisage, and I hope to
            see you next year and in years future at Balisage.
