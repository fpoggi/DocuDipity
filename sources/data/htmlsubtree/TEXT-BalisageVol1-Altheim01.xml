               Wiki software has historically provided little support for any form of
               organizational structure. Even given the assumption that the majority of wiki
               users have previous experience with file system-like hierarchies, most wiki
               systems keep things simple (as is the wiki way) and employ a flat page structure.
               As a wiki grows beyond a few dozen pages, some form of organization becomes
               increasingly necessary. This has typically been accomplished by adding
               “category links” to each page, essentially
               
               <div class="emphasis e9" role="ital">ad hoc</div> terms from an unstructured and
               uncontrolled vocabulary. Because these terms are themselves
               often undefined it can be difficult to ascertain the reason why a given page
               belongs to a category. Even when this is done carefully, as the number of terms
               in the categorization grows a classification scheme for the terms themselves
               likewise becomes increasingly necessary.

            <div class="para e10">This paper describes problems with existing wiki and “semantic
               wiki” categorization schemes and outlines an approach to information

               looking to library science for solutions. It describes the design and
               implementation of a wiki system permitting user-authored

            As with any document collection, as a wiki grows its need for some form of organization
            increases
            proportionately. It's not uncommon for wikis to have hundreds or even thousands of
            pages, without
            even considering the rather atypical Wikipedia (which as of July 2008 claims “approximately
            ten million articles in 253 languages”). Yet Wikipedia has no explicit classification
            scheme.

                           <div class="emphasis e46" role="ital">category</div> as an ad hoc division within a subject domain
                           absent an explicit classification scheme. Whereas classification may be said to be
                           systematic,
                           categorization need not be. Categorization is a preliminary process in the creation
                           of a classification
                           scheme but in informal or colloquial systems may be the only process. In library science
                           a category is
                           sometimes considered synonymous with a 
                           <div class="emphasis e47" role="ital">facet</div> (from Faceted Classification).

               on wikis relies on untyped web links,
               usually camel-case prefixing a category name with the word "Category" (e.g.,
               “CategoryHomePage”, “CategoryDiscussion”, etc.). Any wiki page containing such a
               link is considered categorized under that category. There a number of problems with
               such a system. First,
               any wiki page containing a given link is categorized accordingly even if that was
               not the intention of
               the link author, as the mere presence of a link – not its traversal – establishes
               the categorization.
               Another is that as the categorization of a given wiki page must be expressed on the
               page itself, there is no
               way to categorize a collection of pages from a different page, via a list or other
               external structure. The
               categorization naming scheme is also bound to the link names; there are no synonyms,
               homographs, equivalent
               terms; no way of characterizing the relations between terms, no thesaurus-like hierarchy,
               indeed, no explicit
               structure at all. One can add or remove categories from a page, but to change the
               categorization of a page one
               must change its name, which breaks existing links, and there is no facility for synthetic
               or combinatory categories
               apart from creating longer and more complicated wiki page names. It is a simple system
               and works reasonably well
               for small document sets.

               inflexible,
               don't take account of the fact that most resources don't fit neatly into one category
               (e.g., a book on 19th century French seascape paintings fits into at least four),
               and there is no
               ability to map context. OneNote users go through the same process as a librarian classifying
               a collection
               of books in the early 19th century: as a book arrives it gets put on a shelf next
               to books at that moment
               deemed similar. If there isn't a suitable shelf a new shelf is created. If a suitable
               category
               isn't clear, one doesn't have the time or has abandoned all hope, OneNote includes
               the obligatory
               category “Unfiled Notes”.

               “Knowledge representation” is a strange concept, when you think about it. What exactly

               <div class="emphasis e81" role="ital">knowledge</div>? How does one 
               <div class="emphasis e82" role="ital">represent</div> knowledge?
               A world of difficulty is opened up by the decomposition of even the simplest statements

               <div class="emphasis e83" role="ital">natural language.</div> While one might agree that the above sentences communicate
               information, do they also represent knowledge? Does the spoken word? How does the
               word “fish” relate
               to our conception of the word, its meaning in our minds? How is the concept of the
               word altered by its being
               composed within the context of the above statements, with their strange (perhaps erroneous)
               grammatical
               constructions? Does what we know about the author or our realization that the characters
               are fictional influence
               our understanding of the word? If we've not read the book, might we assume Suzy is
               a fish, instead of
               understanding that (in the “reality” or context of the book) Fauna is explaining Suzy's
               horoscope
               to her, that she was born under the sign of Pisces, the

               the statements 
               <div class="emphasis e85" role="ital">correct</div>, and given any notion of judgment of such correctness,
               in what context can they be evaluated? And more obliquely, what does "being a Pisces"

               Any system dealing with the interplay of knowledge representation and phenomenology
               is also complicated by the
               presence of ambiguity in natural language. While considered a favorable quality of
               poets and writers it isn't
               appropriate for description within the sciences, even though the terminology found
               in the domains of knowledge
               representation and ontological engineering is rife with it. As Allen Newell noted

               “knowledge” within that community is “informal”. Despite people's common anthropomorphization

               “knowledge

               set of rules;
               likewise “common sense reasoning” relies on mistaken notions of a “common sense” and
               “reasoning”. The list goes on. The historical use of seductive marketing language
               as a means of obtaining
               grant funding made the introduction of “semantic” to the lexicon of the Web almost
               inevitable. Now

                        When we try to understand the thought or discourse of others, the task can be divided
                        initially into
                        two parts: understanding what they are thinking or talking about and understanding
                        what they are
                        thinking or saying about it. My primary aim here is to present a view of the relation
                        between what
                        is 
                        <div class="emphasis e121" role="ital">said</div> or 
                        <div class="emphasis e122" role="ital">thought</div> and what it is

                        <div class="emphasis e123" role="ital">about</div>. The former is the propositional dimension of
                        thought and talk, and the latter is its 
                        <div class="emphasis e124" role="ital">representational</div> dimension.
                        The question I address is why any state or utterance that has propositional content
                        also should be
                        understood as having representational content. (For this is so much as to be a question,
                        it must be
                        possible to characterize propositional content in nonrepresentational terms.)

                        <div class="emphasis e126" role="ital">social</div> articulation – how a
                        propositionally contentful belief or claim can have a different significance from
                        the perspective of
                        the individual or claimer, on the one hand, than it does from the perspective of one
                        who attributes
                        that belief or claim to the individual, on the other. The context within which concern
                        with what is
                        thought and talked

               It should be noted that as described above, we could hardly design a system that relied

               The design is therefore distinctly

               In many cases these “semantic wikis” may provide a logical framework but often no

               schemes (where they
               exist at all). Categorization terms or annotations are themselves often ungrounded,
               undefined, or when they are,
               they force users into a predefined schema, often defined in a formal logic not otherwise
               followed by, related or
               appropriate to the user-created structure, such as using set-theoretic language to

                        one-to-one relationship between terms and their referents. The referential semantics
                        of a
                        subject language deals with the generalized homonym problem. It consists of methods
                        for
                        restricting term referents so that any given term has one and only one meaning. The
                        relational
                        semantics of a subject language deals with the generalized synonym problem and consists
                        of
                        methods for linking terms within similar or related meanings.

               in various ways. Svenonius
               notes that this can be accomplished either semantically, via domain specification,
               qualifiers and/or annotations,

               the librarians who classified
               a book that has broken so many boundaries. All classification schemes have their limitations
               and failings,
               including the very human problem of an inability to see into the future. The flexibility
               of allowing classifications
               to evolve without breaking is extremely important, especially during the early stages,
               where categories are still
               relatively unformed. Notably, this problem plagued expert systems implementations,
               where later changes to root level
               concepts were very difficult to accomplish (e.g., a change of logical foundations,

               reflects a common error in knowledge representation texts of conflating IsA with a

               the “Generic Relation” (ostensibly, superclass-subclass) and
               “Instance” (class-instance) relations. We provide the two Z39.19 generic

               of
               expressing them using a simple wiki-like syntax. JSPWiki has a number of extensibility
               features, the WikiPlugin API being the most suitable for developing syntax-level functionality.

               JSPWiki augments its formatting and linking syntax with a plugin syntax, where a reference
               to the plugin name is followed by a plugin body, which may contain one or more named
               parameters.
               For example, to transclude the wiki page “CopyrightStatement” using the InsertPage
               plugin one would include the following wiki text:
               
            </div>

               When the WikiEngine encounters this plugin syntax it instantiates a plugin object

               vocabulary, this vocabulary
               in keeping with the rest of JSPWiki's plugin syntax. Users already familiar with other
               JSPWiki plugins would find nothing

               In practice almost all of the plugins developed for the project are domain-specific
               subclasses of either the
               AssertionPlugin or AssertedPlugin, developed to provide a specific feature based on
               a shorthand wiki text syntax.
               Some plugins are aliased to provide simpler or alternative names or to preset certain
               default values. For example,
               the Z39.19 predicates (e.g., “IsNarrowerThan”) were all included by presetting the
               current wiki page as

               bogged down in the details of the
               syntax. Even the use of the word “assert” might be seen as overly technical by many.
               As the terminology

               Given our model of Assertions as simple binary relations, the translation to a Topic
               Map is straightforward.
               As described previously, the Assertion object contains references to the wiki page
               names for Subject,
               Predicate, and Object, the origin wiki page and a creation timestamp. Each wiki page
               name reference is
               converted to a Topic whose base name matches the wiki page name, with the page URL
               as a subject identifier.
               The Predicate is further typed as some descendant class of Relation within the Topic
               Map's subsumption
               hierarchy for relations. The Assertion itself is converted to a Topic Map Association,
               typed by the
               Predicate's Topic and also reified as a Topic. The timestamp is added as a property
               to this Association.
               If any of the wiki page name references match an existing Topic name the existing
               Topic is used. We are not
               currently scoping page names but will likely add scope to all names in the future

               been marked as transitive,
               such as ancestor and descendant tests, plus a few utility methods. Most return a boolean
               value so that they can
               be chained. As this functionality can easily be accommodated within the current use
               of wiki plugins no additional
               interfaces have been developed.

               One of the features of the system is the ability to provide run-time augmentation
               with the addition of drop-in
               LTM files as Topic Map modules. For example, if a user creates a wiki page called
               “Portugal” and
               asserts that Portugal IsA Country, we look up the
               page name in the ISO 3166 Country Codes for Topic Maps, as well as making any additional
               assertions about that
               Topic based on any Associations in the Topic Map.

               Modules available, in development, or planned include ontologies for languages and
               countries, places, place
               names, events, geocode, measurement and datatypes, mappings to other library subject
               headings, and various other
               subject domains. One idea in the works incorporates a place names to latitude-longitude
               database to permit
               inclusion of Google Maps. For example, any wiki page asserted as a place would look
               up its wiki page name in
               the place names database, then use a wiki plugin to insert a Google Map for that location.
               This remains an area
               ripe for further exploration, and will likely be determined in part by user feedback.

               With all of this additional machinery behind the scenes, what effect does this have
               on the user experience?
               It must be said that, to reiterate one of the requirements, there is little desire
               to expose a great deal of
               complexity, particularly for readers. We likewise have on occasion decided not to
               implement a feature when it
               was seen to significantly add to the complexity of either the browsing or editing
               experience. Thus, most of
               the Assertion Framework features are experienced as links, structure displays or improved
               search or navigation.
               For example, the generated output from an AssertionPlugin shows the Subject, Predicate
               and Object as active
               wiki page links. A hideable navigational panel has been added to the page footer that
               displays any assertions
               or other information queried from the Topic Map for that wiki page.

            The Assertion Framework is still in a prototype state so there are many questions
            as to the viability of both
            the approach and implementation. An upcoming National Library of New Zealand project
            related to the Māori
            Subject Headings has been proposed that would use two wikis to perform a cross-dialect
            comparison of terms
            between the predominant te reo Māori language and a Taranaki dialect. We look forward
            to testing the
            system in a semi-controlled environment.

         <div class="para e698">
            This paper has put a substantial focus on epistemological and design issues rather
            than on implementation details.
            The reason for this is that the central innovation is not seen as the marrying of
            a Topic Map engine with a wiki
            – any programmer could accomplish that – but in the investigation into what the use
            of this
            
            <div class="emphasis e699" role="ital">means</div>, i.e., does the expression of declarative statements incur an entailment
            or not? And if so, of what order? Surely there is no single answer to this question,
            but in the same way as people
            commonly anthropomorphize machines (hell, we anthropomorphize 
            <div class="emphasis e700" role="ital">rocks</div>), this paper
            is, if anything, meant to inject a note of caution into inferring that the systems
            we develop do more than they do,
            that our claims notwithstanding we are in large part still playing with toys.
