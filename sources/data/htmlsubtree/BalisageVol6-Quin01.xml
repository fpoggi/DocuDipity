         <div class="para e27">The requirements for archiving a document for a hundred years are
            very different from the requirements for archiving the same document for one year,
            or for five years. As we try to prepare for even longer term storage, the number
            of unknowns increases greatly.
         </div>
         <div class="para e28">This paper suggests ways to manage some of those unknowns, and to
            prepare for as many of them as possible: in other words, ways to store XML-encoded
            documents in such a way as to have some reasonable expectation that they can
            be decoded at some unspecified time in the future and used.

            <div class="para e33">Before we can talk about storing documents for a long time, we must decide what we
               mean by the term document.
               This is not sophistry: an XML document generally consists of multiple parts, and,
               as will be discussed further, we must
               be careful in determining the boundary of the document for the purpose of preservation.
               Let the term XML Document, then, in this
               paper, denote a sequence of characters represented digitally on a computer such that
               the sequence of
               characters satisfies the productions and constraints
               of the XML specification. We shall be neither more not less precise, but rather shall
               qualify or expand upon this base term as needed.
               Our definition excludes non-digital representations: if one were to print out an XML
               document onto paper, and then make a video of
               the paper, the video would not, by our definition, constitute an XML document.

         <div class="para e69">The interest in archiving machine-machine communication is low because the (human)
            programmers
            of our computers decided that the messages were not of interest to humans, and because
            instead of archiving
            actual messages, it is customary to archive logs of many such messages. For example,
            it is not usually of
            interest to record the mouse pointer location on a computer screen when a particular
            icon was clicked,
            except in human-computer interaction usability research; archiving the details of
            that event is unlikely
            to be of use to anyone, even where, as with  XCB 
            <div class="citation e70" linkend="bibxcb">XCB</div>,
            it was in XML. Even a usability researcher would be unlikely to find it useful without
            further information, such as what icon was displayed there, what task the user was
            attempting, whether she was tired,
            and so forth. The machine-to-machine message in this example is not complete without
            its context, and does
            not constitute a sustained rhetoric or literature. Most machine-to-machine communication
            happens entirely
            without human intervention, or with only indirect intervention. Note that a log file,
            recording a summary of
            such communications, is an instance of machine to person communication, and is in
            a different category.

         <div class="para e71">Machine to Person communication designates machine-generated documents, and these
            constitute a broad range of literature, ranging from error
            messages and log files to random poetry. In some cases it is more interesting to archive
            the algorithms used
            to generate the random poetry, perhaps with some examples. In this paper we will consider
            randomly generated
            literature to be a subset of person to person communication, with the creator being
            the person who wrote the
            program and therefore controlled the domain of discourse. Machine-generated documents
            such as error
            messages that are part of a larger context can be archived only as part of a larger
            context, as we shall see.
            It would make little sense to archive a document whose entire content was "File not
            found," although files
            containing such messages can be a great source of confusion to users.

         <div class="para e77">Documents do not exist in isolation. They are created, stored and retrieved using
            digital computers.
            When a Person reads a document, or part of a document, what is understood is, as with
            any piece of
            literature or cultural artifact, bounded on all sides by that culture. Once the context
            of creation is lost,
            understanding of the artifact is necessarily incomplete. Documents are part of a culture
            that includes other documents
            as well as social conventions and shared knowledge. We shall use the term External
            Context to denote the environment,
            political, social, technological and cultural, surrounding a document.
            
         </div>
         <div class="para e78">How an ancient object was used is often a mystery. Similarly, there are documents
            in existence which
            appear to be works of literature of some kind, but which cannot now be deciphered
            at all.  In some
            cases, such as the Phaistos Disc, there is almost no surviving context at all. In
            others, such as the one-time key
            encryption used by Dee and Kelly in Bohemia 
            <div class="citation e79" linkend="bibbab"></div>, there is some knowledge about the purpose of the documents,
            but not necessarily sufficient information to decode them. In other cases, knowledge
            is incomplete.
         </div>
         <div class="para e80">Misunderstandings, corruption in copying, ignorance, politics and flawed textual theories
            have
            all come into play with documents such as Biblical translations. Famously, “Peace
            on Earth and good will to all
            men” is now considered to be more accurately rendered, “Peace on Earth to all men
            of good will.” Was
            the genitive case not noticed by the translators of the King James Bible, or did it
            not exist in their primary texts, or did they choose a silent
            emendation? We might like to imagine that when we archive computer texts, we will
            not have problems with corruption. But in
            practice it is not corruption but a lost context that is the problem. Consider the
            way that the English language has
            changed an as short a time as three hundred years:“indifference” was a word that in
            the 1700s meant without
            difference, impartial; today a statement that God metes out justice with indifference
            would not be considered respectful.

         <div class="para e81">In order to reconstruct the significance of a text, then, recipients of our putative
            archived XML Document, a Very Long Time from now,
            will need to understand not only the computer formats we have used but also the natural-language
            parts of our text.
            For XML documents, where it is common practice to embed natural-language terms in
            markup as element names or identifiers,
            natural language appears not only in document content, but also in the actual document

            use and implicit shared understanding
            between document creator and audience in these examples can be lost by the Very Long
            Time; this tacit knowledge
            must therefore be documented and made explicit if the archived document is to be interpreted
            as it was intended.

            in adding extra background information may seem onerous, and may require a very different
            sort of skill than
            writing the document. In a corporate environment, sanctions are generally available
            to require additional
            information to be of at least minimal accuracy and completeness; in a university or
            library environment, the
            mandate for making tacit knowledge manifest as explicit knowledge (See 
            <div class="citation e84" linkend="bibrhetorical">Applen and McDaniel</div>, chh. 1 and 3) may

         <div class="para e85">Socio-political contexts, organizational contexts, corporate cultures and fashion
            can also all affect the
            interpretation of documents. One cannot archive an entire culture in order to explain
            a single document, but
            neither can one understand an entire culture from a single document.

         <div class="para e86">Every document necessarily stands in some relationship to other documents. That relationship

            explanations for words found in other documents. An explicit link might point from

            culture of the creators of documents
            as well as of the intended recipients, the other documents created or preexisting

         <div class="para e97">George Landow writes (pp. 267ff) about the politics of hypertext; of particular relevance
            here is the idea that providing
            easier access to some documents implies harder access to others: the choice of which
            documents to archive is (or
            can be) a political decision every bit as much as decisions about which books to keep
            on the shelves in a
            public library.
         </div>
         <div class="para e98">It is not technically feasible to archive all documents. Even if we restrict ourselves
            to the domain of
            person-to-person communication, we still find that the sheer volume of electronic
            mail, especially when
            spam is included, simply makes it harder to find information later. In addition, privacy
            concerns mean that it
            is not always desirable to archive everything. Some public libraries now routinely
            delete book borrowing
            information, so that they cannot be required to identify which books a particular
            individual may have read.
            If not all documents are to be archived, some documents must be rejected. In a corporate
            research environment it might
            be that reports are archived, but not research notes, for example. Yet, in the future,
            those notes might be
            considered a highly valuable resource for understanding and validating (or otherwise)

            <div class="para e105">It is not reasonable to expect modern computer storage devices to remain functional
               for A Very Long Time. Typical values for A Very Long Time for most computer equipment
               today are
               measured in thousands of hours, not
               thousands of years. Magnetic tapes degrade over time, as do optical storage media
               such as
               compact discs. Active devices such as rotating hard drives have dependencies on voltage
               and
               current levels, on specific versions of software drivers for specific operating systems,
               and, since
               they contain firmware, may also fail after a specific date.

            <div class="para e106">It is possible to run a digital archive in such a way that data is periodically migrated
               to
               newer media. Such a strategy assumes a continued supply of funding and replacement
               media.
               It is also possible for an organization to rely on external archiving services, but
               this does not solve
               the question of ensuring that A Very Long Time is sufficiently great.

            <div class="para e108">The author of this document once unpacked a computer system; inside the box was also
               a manual in
               many ring-bound volumes, and it was necessary to open shrink-wrapped stacks of hole-punched
               paper
               and insert them into the proper binders. One of these manuals was a chapter explaining
               how to off-load
               the box with a fork-lift truck, and how to open the box. Of course, in order to discover
               these instructions,
               it was necessary to open the box. When archiving for a Very Long Time, it is important
               to label the
               archive in multiple languages, with a pen, on the outside of the box. Who, in a thousand
               years from now,
               would guess that an object clearly marked 90 Minutes Audio Cassette actually contained
               a computer program?

            <div class="para e111">Computer users are accustomed to metaphors presented by graphical user interfaces.
               For example, a Folder is used as a metaphor for a group of documents. But the actual
               implementation
               of a File System on most operating systems today involves a list of hard disk block
               numbers or storage extents.
               It might be that a future data archaeologist will have to inspect those individual
               disk blocks and piece
               them together. This process is made considerably easier if files larger than a single
               block are in plain text
               wherever possible, rather than (for example) being compressed. In addition, the fewer
               layers that must be
               penetrated, the easier the task, so store individual files in folders (directories)
               rather than in binary
               formats such as zip or tar archives. The process of reconstructing data from a damaged
               CD-ROM or
               hard drive is tedious, but today at least it is a known skill; many skills fall into
               disuse, and today
               few people can repair a hole in a saucepan, sharpen a wooden ploughshare, or correctly
               aim a ballista. If an important archive is to be stored for a long time, the layout
               of the storage
               system file systems must be documented on a separate physical medium.

               <div class="para e115">A Coded Character Set, or Encoding, is a mapping from integers (or, more properly,
                  codes of some sort) into characters.
                  Some encodings are context sensitive, so that the same integer may map to different
                  characters in different contexts; ISO 2022-JP is an example of such an encoding mechanism.
                  Others are context-free, so that the same integer always maps to the same logical
                  character.
                  Over time, character encodings tend to be modified, for example by introducing the
                  Euro sign,
                  or by fixing minor bugs. There is no general concept of version numbers for encodings,
                  however,
                  so that there is no way to determining which historical version of a given encoding
                  was in use
                  when a document was created. Some encodings (most notably IBM EBCDIC) also have many
                  variations, with no overall consistent, standard naming scheme.

                  of integers,

                  make sense of
                  the information, the characters must be presented in some readable form. In the West
                  this is most often
                  done using alphabetic symbols from the Latin script. The software that controls
                  the mapping from characters to glyphs is a Text Layout Engine. This software generally
                  reads tables to
                  indicate that particular sequences of characters are to be displayed as particular
                  sequences
                  of character shapes; the definitions of those replacement sequences ans the corresponding
                  character shapes (glyphs) are defined in Fonts. In order to read a computer file then,
                  the integers
                  must be mapped to characters, the characters to glyphs, and the glyphs rendered on

                  called TrueType; it would be unreasonable to expect that software
                  written today will still be runnable twenty years from now. Therefore, as part
                  of archiving a document for A Very Long Time, we must also archive depictions of
                  the glyphs, perhaps as bitmap images, along with documentation of the bitmap

               <div class="para e163">Some digital documents, like antiquarian books, are scarcer than others. With antiquarian
                  books,
                  commercial value is related both to scarcity and to interest. With digital documents,
                  commercial
                  value is determined by ease of availability and interest. Documents that are widely
                  copied are easier
                  to access. The license or copyright by which digital documents are released determines
                  how easy
                  it is for other people to share copies of them. However, as digital documents are
                  more widely disseminated,
                  there is a greater chance of corrupted or changed copies emerging. This can be counteracted
                  by
                  providing a digital fingerprint, known as a signature or checksum hash, along with
                  the file. This
                  does not prevent alterations, but makes it possible for people to test to see if the
                  file has been changed.

               <div class="para e164">Making archived documents widely available in unchanged form is sometimes referred
                  to as “mirroring.” A
                  collection of documents that is widely disseminated in this way can survive even if
                  only one of the mirror sites
                  survives. However, for this to happen, the mirrors must be funded.

                  all of the
                  archives would probably be closed. Mirroring by multiple organizations is more robust,
                  but there has to be
                  a suitably sustainable funding source. Sometimes this can be provided by government
                  grants; in other
                  cases, if the documents are suitably licensed, and can be made public for commercial
                  use,
                  advertising on Web sites hosting the archive can suffice. In some communities there

            <div class="para e221">If your document format has links, whether explicit or implicit, you should check
               them before
               committing the document or documents to the archive. As a minimum, make sure that
               all link
               targets exist. Better, make sure that the links go where they should. For example,
               check the titles
               of sections that are the targets of links, perhaps to the content of an element in
               the link that exists
               only for that purpose. For off-site links, for example to Web sites, consider archiving
               a surrogate,
               or including a description of the remote content. Archiving the actual remote Web
               page may
               require explicit permission, but for some projects this is worth while. Ensure that
               you are checking
               linked documents in your collection that you are about to archive, and that your link
               checker
               is not reaching out to a production server elsewhere in your organization! All of
               this requires provision in
               the design of an XML document format.
            </div>
            <div class="para e222">Although the World Wide Web Consortium has produced a specification for marking up
               hypertext links in XML, 
               <div class="code e223">xlink</div>, this specification is not likely to
               be sufficient even for explicit links, as it does not provide for a pattern to match
               against a given target element in order to validate a link.
            </div>
            <div class="para e224">The 
               <div class="code e225">xlink</div> specification does
               not attempt at all to support implicit links, where, for example, a 
               <div class="code e226">part-number</div> element
               within a step of a repair procedure is treated as a link to a database of parts, and
               for printing
               is augmented by a description of the part, and for online publication also becomes
               a hyperlink to an online catalogue. Like implicit content from default elements and
               attributes,
               implicit links are difficult to archive. The ISO SGML HyTime specification did have
               support, using a
               mechanism termed Architectural Forms, for at least some level of implicit linking,
               but HyTime has
               not been adopted by the XML community.
               
            </div>
            <div class="para e227">The best approach to linking in documents that are expected to be archived, then,
               is to include in each document some information about link targets. This could be
               a short
               textual description or an entire resource. For the purpose of link checking, static
               content
               in the document can be used, such as an attribute whose value specifies an XPath expression,
               and another attribute giving a regular expression (a text pattern) that the result
               of evaluating
               that XPath expression must match. For example, one might say that the nearest enclosing
               section
               title of the link target must contain the word Plastic. The utility of this is at
               archive creation time,
               and during the regular document maintenance life-cycle.

            <div class="para e230">After A Very Long Time, language will have changed. Documents that have been translated
               into multiple languages clearly have a better chance of bing understood. A single
               Rosetta Stone
               is more likely to survive in one place than three separate stones: consider archiving
               a single file
               	    containing all of the translations, or at least a fragment from each language,
               	    perhaps first a German paragraph and then a French one and then
               a Swedish one (in alphabetical order by their own names, but that breaks down for
               languages written
               with non-Latin scripts). Remember that any piece of human-readable text may need to
               contain markup
               in some language or other, whether to delimit right-to-left and left-to-right components,
               or for Ruby-style annotations, or for emphasis. As a result, all natural-language
               fragments should
               be in XML elements (not attributes), where they can be distinguished by 
               <div class="code e231">xml:lang</div> values.
               Designing XML documents for translation has been described elsewhere [e.g. ITS] in
               detail.
            </div>
            <div class="para e232">It can be helpful to have block-level translations, so that (for example)
               	    a paragraph or list item in one language can be immediately followed by

               dream journal might have an introduction that says the author wrote
               down memories of dreams each day for a year, but the wider
               context might include that this was part of a therapeutic exercise in
               working out resentment towards alien visitors, and that, after
               a year, the writer's perception about the visitors was changed. This
               sort of explanation is not generally considered necessary for a work of fiction,
               but the boundaries between perception and construction become
               less clearly discernible over time. Harry Potter is a fictional boy,
