         <div class="para e38">The Journal and Book publishing units of ACS Pubs produces over forty STM
            peer-reviewed journals focused on various disciplines of chemistry. In 2012, ACS Pubs
            expects to publish about 325,000 pages in approximately 40,000 articles
            (manuscripts).
         </div>
         <div class="para e39">Chemists from around the world document their research results and submit manuscripts
            to ACS of their findings for peer review and publication. Once a manuscript has been
            reviewed and accepted for publication, ACS receives it in the document format submitted
            by the author (Microsoft Word or LaTeX, for example). ACS has standardized on XML
            as the
            internal manuscript format and uses an “XML-first” approach to facilitate the production
            and publication processes. Therefore, before any processing occurs, the author’s
            original document is sent to a vendor for conversion into XML, using a DTD that is
            a
            customized version of the 
            <div xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" class="link e40" xlink:actuate="onRequest" xlink:href="http://dtd.nlm.nih.gov/" xlink:show="new" xlink:type="simple">NLM article DTD</div>. (See 
            <div class="xref e41" linkend="ACS-Tagsets"></div>.)
         </div>
         <div class="para e42">After the manuscript is converted to XML, ACS staff that have Chemistry or related
            scientific degrees (“Technical Editors”) prepare it for publication, editing the paper
            for clarity and technical content (see 
            <div class="xref e43" linkend="ACS-Style-Guide"></div>) and ensuring
            proper markup of content. A proof version of the manuscript is sent to the author
            (in
            PDF format) for their review and the author’s corrections are applied before it is
            published on the

            </div> and also in print. The composition process of journal
            manuscripts (proof, web, and print PDFs) has recently been automated (see 
            <div class="xref e45" linkend="ACS-Auto-Comp"></div>), with great success. The high-level of quality of the XML
            input to the composition engine is critical to the successful composition results.

         <div class="title e56">Why XML Quality is Critical</div>
         <div class="para e57">All of the processing that takes place on the text of each manuscript is performed
            after its conversion into XML. Technical Editors use a customized XML editor when
            they
            edit the manuscript, and all of the tools which automate the processing of manuscripts
            expect and require XML input. The quality of this XML is critical to the successful
            completion of each of these tools. A manuscript in XML format must be properly tagged
            so
            that it can be parsed. This is easily checked using the DTD. If all required document
            elements are present in the XML, and the contents of each of the document elements
            are
            valid within their context, then a manuscript has an acceptable quality level for
            our
            automation tools. As an example, our tools cannot understand a Publication Year with
            a
            value of “next year or maybe the year after”. Documents with invalid tagging or content
            require manual intervention to be processed for publication. Given the sheer quantity
            of
            XML processed daily at ACS, manual intervention must be a very tiny exception to keep
            production costs down and time-to-publication intervals competitive.
         </div>
         <div class="para e58">To enhance the quality of the XML tagging and contents of each manuscript, validation
            tools and tools that perform automatic content and tagging changes (“edits”) were
            developed internally by ACS staff. The validation tools are run before the initial
            version of the XML content is accepted from the vendor, and again between most workflow
            stages. The automatic content and tagging edits are performed before and after the
            Technical Editors edit the manuscript.
         </div>
      </div><a name="Validations(QualityEnforced)ANCHOR" href="#mainContainerTitleTOC" class="anchor">toc</a><div class="section e59">
         <div class="title e60">Validations (Quality Enforced)</div>
         <div class="para e61">There are hundreds of custom validations that are performed on each manuscript.
            Validations are typically executed as a manuscript transitions from one workflow stage
            to the next. Individual validation checks are collected in logical groups, and those
            logical groups of validations are executed by controllers that focus on the workflow
            stage of the manuscript.
         </div>
         <div class="para e62">Some validation requests occur independently of workflow transitions. The vendor who
            converts the manuscript from the author’s original document format into XML executes

            Editors may execute our validations directly within their XML editor (Arbortext) to
            check the validity of a manuscript before they attempt to promote it. Because validation
            requests come from a variety of sources, a web service was developed as a common entry
            point for execution of validations (

         <div class="para e71">Validation violations, which indicate invalid XML tagging or invalid content, are
            categorized into three severities: warnings, errors, and fatal errors. Severe validation
            violations may prevent a manuscript from proceeding to the next workflow stage, which
            would require manual intervention. This is dependent on the particular stage, however.
            Violations that would halt processing at one point might be tolerated at a different
            point, particularly if a following stage of processing will involve staff interaction
            with the manuscript.
         </div>
         <div class="para e72">When a violation is detected, details are enclosed in a “processing-comment” element
            that contains a custom message for the violation. See the example: 
            <div class="xref e73" linkend="processing-comment"></div>. That element is inserted into the manuscript XML. If
            possible, it is inserted close to the location where the violation occurred. If the
            violation is not location-specific within the XML, the message element is placed close
            to the top of the XML document. Validation violation messages are interpreted by staff
            who take the appropriate corrective action. Violation messages are removed automatically
            when a manuscript “passes” validations and moves along in the workflow.
         </div>
         <div class="para e74">If a severe violation exists in the new converted manuscript XML that is sent from
            the
            vendor, it is automatically rejected back to the vendor. Both the vendor and ACS receive
            notifications of the rejections so that we can track any chronic issues and also ensure
            that the violations are corrected and the manuscript is resent.
         </div>
         <div class="para e75">ACS utilizes Documentum, a content management system, to store and process
            manuscripts. Documentum includes a Java API for custom application integration. ACS
            content validations are implemented using a few different technologies, including
            Java
            and Groovy. Implementing validations in Java and Groovy allow for validation of the
            manuscript content against data stored in the Documentum database, and the behavior
            of
            some validations change in subtle ways depending on manuscript attributes that are
            stored in the Documentum database. Validations written in Groovy may be developed
            quickly and deployed into production without incurring down-time.
         </div>
         <div class="para e76">The framework and validations that were implemented using Groovy were inspired by
            some
            of the main concepts of

            such as the use of

            expressions and assertion style programming. Individual validations that had no
            dependency on information stored in the content management system could have been
            implemented using Schematron. However, many validations did have that dependency,
            and
            there was a desire for a consistent approach in validation code.

         <div class="para e98">At two different times during the processing of a manuscript, content and tagging
            changes are automatically applied to the XML document. The first time (“pre-edit”)
            occurs between the stages when the manuscript is converted into XML and when the
            Technical Editor edits it.
         </div>
         <div class="para e99">Pre-edits are commonly applied content corrections and tagging enhancements. For
            example, commonly misspelled (mispelled?) words are automatically corrected. Another
            simple example is that 
            <div class="code e100">&lt;title-group&gt;</div> elements are added if they are
            missing. 
         </div>
         <div class="para e101">The goal of these automatic edits is twofold: to reduce the amount of time Technical
            Editors spend manually making common changes, and to increase quality by lowering
            the
            chances that instances of errors slip through the manual editing process. (Humans
            won’t
            catch every mispelled word!)
         </div>
         <div class="para e102">Automatic edits are also applied after the Technical Editors complete the manual
            editing process. These edits (“post-edits”) do not typically alter the element contents,
            but target the element tagging. Tagging is normalized (extraneous attributes removed,
            etc.) and the manuscript is prepared for future stages, such as web and print
            publication.
         </div>
         <div class="para e103">The automatic edit process itself is complex, and is accomplished using a combination
            of technologies. Many edits are implemented in Java after the XML document has been
            parsed. Some edits are implemented using XSL templates. We have developed thousands
            of
            individual edits, and continue to add them to our collection.

            <div class="para e126">With a few exceptions, this largely boiled down to following the author submitted
               authority document. After the source document is converted to XML and returned to
               ACS, Technical Editors are responsible for editing the paper according to
               established standards. After consideration of many options, it was determined that
               the “goodness” of a paper was tied to the time it took the Technical Editor to fix
               any mistakes that happened in conversion; time that was very costly. Moreover, this
               added the element of the criticality of an error, rather than just the number of
               errors. A small team of ACS staff members worked to devise the Conversion Scorecard
               where the Technical Editor could record the minutes they took to fix problems while
               they were editing the manuscript. This process allowed ACS to integrate scoring into
               the existing editing process to make the data collection process as efficient as
               possible. Following is a sample section from the Conversion Scorecard.

            <div class="para e154">The scoring methodology having been determined, the next issue was how to apply
               that to the approximately 40,000 manuscripts received by ACS for publication in a
               year in an efficient yet statistically valid manner. One important factor was that
               even with the scorecard, scoring was somewhat complicated. For the scores to be
               valid, the same criteria had to be applied in deciding if something was an issue.
               Also, two Technical Editors had to apply very similar resources to fix the same
               issue in two different papers. In order to maintain this consistency, a small team
               of scorers was selected who could be trained to use the same standards and then
               monitored to ensure that they were recording time in a similar manner. Six of our
               most effective and efficient Technical Editors were selected, trained, and then
               evaluated to ensure their scoring was uniform by having them independently score the
               same set of manuscripts.
            </div>
            <div class="para e155">With the small scoring team in place, the next determination was to find the
               smallest sample of manuscripts that could be scored and still give a very high
               degree of confidence that the sample was representative of the entire manuscript
               population. A sampling technique which was developed in-house by a Quality
               Management team in another division of ACS was used. That team started with standard
               sampling protocols taught in any statistical course, then created and tested a
               technique used to prove that scoring a relatively small number of items from a huge
               population was statistically representative of the entire population. The technique
               consisted of randomly selecting approximately 10% of the manuscripts submitted in
               a
               month, or 60 manuscripts. From that group of 60 manuscripts, 40 manuscripts were
               randomly selected. From that sub-sample of 40, 20 manuscripts were randomly
               selected. That sub-sub sample was then scored. The overall standard mean score and
               the standard deviation for the sub-sub sample was determined. Then the remaining 20
               manuscripts were scored (those not included in the first sub-sub sample). The
               overall standard mean and standard deviation for this set was then determined. In
               looking at the standard deviation from the two sets and the mean scores, it was
               determined with a confidence of 90% (which is standard for non-life threatening
               applications), that the mean score for a random sample of 20 manuscripts was within
               11% of the score for the entire population. The width of this interval was deemed
               acceptable.
            </div>
            <div class="para e156">Given this number, open source “random selector” code was used to select 240
               numbers from 1-40,000, which was 20 manuscripts per month for 12 months. The 240
               random numbers were entered in a table. When a manuscript was submitted to the
               workflow with a sequential number that matched a number in the table, that
               manuscript was flagged. For example, if 1253 was a number in the table, when the
               1253rd manuscript of the year was submitted, then a scoring attribute for that
               manuscript was updated in our workflow system and an email was sent to the scoring
               team telling them the manuscript was ready to be scored as soon as it returned from
               conversion.
            </div>
            <div class="para e157">When ACS first started scoring, the average number of minutes to fix a manuscript
               was 9.5. Today the number is between 1 and 2 minutes per manuscript. This
               significant improvement was achieved by a collaborative effort with the vendor to
               focus on the same issues and apply continuous improvement to those issues. This
               conversion score is reported weekly both internally and to the vendor. One of the
               real advantages of the reporting is that it is immediately obvious if there has been
               a change that affects the quality.

            <div class="title e159">Vendor Validations</div>
            <div class="para e160">Another way the quality of our converted XML is ensured is by allowing the vendor
               to call our web service to run the ACS validations program. As mentioned earlier,
               ACS has a robust validations system that is applied to manuscripts at many points
               throughout the production workflow, including when manuscripts are returned by the
               vendor. Rather than waiting until a manuscript is returned to run those validations,
               ACS opened up the validations via web service to the vendor, significantly reducing
               the number of manuscripts ever sent to ACS which have validation errors. This also
               helped the vendor to meet turnaround time SLOs.

            <div class="para e161">The validations check against our DTD but also against established conversion
               conventions. Following is an example of a validations error the vendor might see

            <div class="para e169">Because ACS edits XML that is relatively complex, understandably some errors that
               are difficult to catch with validations are introduced during technical editing.
               These errors often interfere with good composition. These mistakes were originally
               addressed via emails between ACS and the vendor. This caused problems when emails
               were lost or sent to out-of-office staff. There was also no enduring record of the
               problems being addressed. Working with the vendor, a way was implemented to reject
               incorrect tagging that affected composition. For example, a table attribute might
               have been set to be anchored instead of as float which resulted in poor rendering
               in
               the composed output. Code was installed at ACS and also at the vendor’s site which
               allowed the vendor to reject a composition request with a meaningful error code. Now
               when the ACS workflow system receives an error code, four things happen:

            positive difference in all aspects of the workflow. Technology is evolving daily and

            think that efforts to ensure XML quality are complete is to already be behind. For
            example, we have made over 30 changes to our validations and pre-edits alone since
            the
            beginning of the year. ACS is committed to continually monitoring and improving the
            processes we have put in place to ensure the quality of our XML.
