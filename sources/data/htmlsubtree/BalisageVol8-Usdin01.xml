            <div class="para e7">Vocabulary is slippery, especially the sorts of technical jargon we are immersed in
               at events like Balisage. When we want to talk about a new idea, process, specification,
               or procedure we have two choices: make up a new word or use a word that is already
               in use to mean something else. New words may be difficult to remember and awkward
               to use. Re-purposing an existing word may cause confusion between the 
               <div class="quote e8">old</div> and your 
               <div class="quote e9">new</div> meaning. In either case, usage of terms changes. The usage of a technical term may
               mutate over time and may evolve differently in different communities. At times it
               is useful for a community to pressure users to use terms to mean what they meant when
               coined, but more often it is simple pedantry to insist that any usage other than that
               of the person who first introduced the term is incorrect. Our challenge is in finding
               that balance.

      <div class="para e22">Good morning.  I want to do two things.  I want to introduce a piece of technology
         that I am about to use.  I want to introduce it primarily for the sake of the speakers,
         but I’ll show it to the rest of you as well.  This is our 
         <div xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" class="link e23" xlink:actuate="onRequest" xlink:href="http://www.timetimer.com/" xlink:show="new" xlink:type="simple">timer</div>.  Set it to however much time you have to speak, and watch your time disappear! 
         I am going to give myself twenty-five minutes.  I don’t think I actually need all
         of it.
      </div>
      <div class="para e24">As several people have already said, we are absolutely delighted to see you.  I see
         old friends, I see new faces, I see some people I have only communicated with in the
         past by email — maybe those are my favorite because it’s nice to actually get to know
         the people in person that you’ve been talking to by email.
      </div>
      <div class="para e25">This is a remarkable group of people.  This is a group of people where when somebody
         says, 
         <div class="quote e26">You know, that’s not actually how it works.  I wrote that, and what really happens
            under the covers is …,
         </div> don’t laugh; they probably did write it.  Maybe make a mental note to ask some more
         questions about it over coffee.
      </div>
      <div class="para e27">As a general rule, in this crowd, when someone makes a preposterous claim — maybe
         especially when they make a preposterous claim — it is probably true.  It may not
         be sensible, but except when they’re playing 
         <div class="quote e28">
            <div class="emphasis e29" role="ital">Balisage</div> Bluff,
         </div>  it’s probably true.
      </div>
      <div class="para e30">You’re also a funny group.  You probably noticed — I know a lot of you noticed — that
         on the registration form one of the things we ask for is 
         <div class="quote e31">Special Requirements such as dietary requirements.</div>  And as I was looking through the registration forms, I was reminded of a very, very
         rainy Sunday afternoon at the end of a very, very long rainy week when my little brother
         was perhaps seven-years-old, and he said to my mother 
         <div class="quote e32">What can I do?</div>  And she proposed something, perhaps, 
         <div class="quote e33">Get out your crayons and draw.</div>  
         <div class="quote e34">I did that yesterday.</div>  
         <div class="quote e35">Okay.  Well, why don’t you play with something-or-other?</div>  
         <div class="quote e36">I don’t wanna.  What can I do?</div>  She said, 
         <div class="quote e37">I already proposed two things.</div>  He said, 
         <div class="quote e38">What can I do that’s fun and I wanna do, and I didn’t do yesterday?</div>  And she said, 
         <div class="quote e39">You’re going to have to solve that problem yourself.</div>
      </div>
      <div class="para e40">Well, looking at your special requirements — you as a group — I have a feeling that
         what you’ve been saying to us is 
         <div class="quote e41">What can I do that’s fun and I wanna do, and that isn’t folding towels, and that I
            didn’t do yesterday?
         </div>  I’m going to suggest to you that if you, for example, look at the options at lunch
         and say, 
         <div class="quote e42">There are two things there I’m allergic to and one I hate, therefore this lunch is
            awful,
         </div> you’re going to be very unhappy.  If you look at the options and say, 
         <div class="quote e43">There are two things I like and one that is what I probably ought to be eating,</div> you will be very happy.  It’s up to you, and you’re going to have to solve that problem
         yourself.  What we have planned for lunch every day is:  a fish-based option, a meat-based
         option, a vegetarian option, and a gluten-free option.  Now I don’t know why the gluten-free
         option isn’t simultaneous with one of the others — and perhaps it will be — but if
         you have sensitivities or issues, ask.  (We have also asked them to label the various
         options.)  But we have a fair amount of variety.
      </div>
      <div class="para e44">So as with lunch, also the conference as a whole.  I had a conversation — oh, now
         several months ago — with, as it happens, an attendee at this conference who had registered
         because 
         <div class="emphasis e45" role="ital">Balisage</div> seemed like a cool conference, and he wanted to come, so he got his institution to
         pay for it and registered.  Then the preliminary program came out, and I got email
         saying 
         <div class="quote e46">How do I cancel my registration?</div>  I wrote back and said, 
         <div class="quote e47">Well, if you really want to cancel your registration, tell us and we’ll credit your
            credit card.  Why do you want to cancel your registration?
         </div>  
         <div class="quote e48">Well, there isn’t very much on that program that is directly related to my job, and
            I don’t have the background for some of it.
         </div>  I said, 
         <div class="quote e49">Please wait for the final program.  We’ve got a bunch of late-breaking slots.</div>  And then the late-breaking talks were posted, and I wrote back and said, 
         <div class="quote e50">Okay, the complete program is up.  Take a look at it.  If you really want to cancel,
            you can cancel, but let me tell you that as far as I’m concerned, the fact that all
            of the conference doesn’t appeal to you is sort of par for the course.  There are
            going to be several sessions at this conference that I will find totally bewildering;
            people are going to talk about things that are just so far outside my area of expertise
            I have no idea what they’re talking about.  There are also several papers on this
            program where I can’t imagine why anybody cares; I’m going to be polite and not tell
            you which.
         </div>  My guess is that each of you agrees with me that there are several papers on the
         program for which you can’t imagine why anybody cares, but if the conference committee
         has done it right, we don’t agree on which ones those are.  So, if you approach this
         conference — by the way, that person is here, and I hope enjoys the conference — as
         
         <div class="quote e51">If every paper isn’t spot on for me at all times, this is a waste of time,</div> then I can tell you right now, this is a waste of time.  If you approach it as a
         place to learn some things, think about some new ideas, and maybe be exposed to some
         things that matter to other people but not to you (or at least not to you right now),
         you’re going to have a great time this week.
      </div>
      <div class="para e52">I would like to talk to some of the speakers at this conference for a moment.  You’re
         going to have a platform; you’re going to be allowed to say pretty much what you want
         to say.  But I would like you not to sound like the teenage child of a good friend
         that I spent some time with not so long ago.  I spent a week with a teenager who taught
         me that I don’t know anything about music.  Well, that didn’t surprise me.  I learned
         that I don’t anything about fashion.  In fact, I don’t even know how to wear a scarf.
         I learned that I don’t know anything about technology, or at least about technology
         that matters, such as, for example, how to get the most out of a cell phone or even
         what phone to buy.  I learned that I don’t read the right books or watch the right
         television.  I learned that my job is easy.  And I learned that there are simple answers
         to all questions:  technological, financial, political, and ethical.  I would like
         to think that most of us have matured just a little bit beyond this particular child
         who knows everything.  The experience sensitized me to easy answers through simplification
         — something that many of us in this room do tend toward.  This process does seem to
         underline many of the pronouncements that I have heard at other conferences and suspect
         we will hear a little too much of this week.
      </div>
      <div class="para e53">While most of my colleagues are a little more circumspect in the way they phrase it,
         I nonetheless would like to warn you not to say 
         <div class="quote e54">My problem area is very complicated, and your problem area is not; there is a simple
            answer to the thing you are working on — let’s focus on the thing I care about.
         </div>  Now I don’t mind you focusing 
         <div class="quote e55">on the thing that I care about,</div> but you know, the things other people are working on, maybe those are hard too. 
         Let’s assume this week that if someone is struggling with a problem you’ve just learned
         about for the first time that the obvious solution that pops into your mind just might
         not take all the subtleties into account.
      </div>
      <div class="para e56">Let’s be careful with our terminology.  We all deal with significant complexity: 
         complex issues, complex technologies.  And the way we communicate is through the use
         of technical terminology — jargon.  The use of jargon is important.  It makes our
         meanings clear; it demonstrates that we know what we’re talking about.  It establishes
         credibility.  I have a client who knows a lot about her documents and her document
         systems and the ways documents are created and produced, and I fairly regularly have
         to remind myself of this because as we’re talking about document models, she not only
         talks about modifying the DDT — I know what she means, I really do know what she means,
         but I alo heard what she said, and it’s a problem.  Worse than that, when what she
         means is 
         <div class="quote e57">Let’s make that attribute have a set of defined values,</div> what she says is 
         <div class="quote e58">Make that a pick-list.</div>  Now, in fact in one of the tools — not even all of the tools she’s going to use
         — in one of the tools she is going to use, that’s the way that will be visualized.
         But that’s what she says, and what it does is erode her credibility.  I’m warning
         you here that this audience is even fussier than I am about correct use of terminology,
         and if you use a technical term incorrectly, there will be a line at the microphone,
         and somebody will very politely say 
         <div class="quote e59">That is correctly called a zagorgaflesh, you know.</div>
      </div>
      <div class="para e60">I was recently confused by someone else who sent me email complaining about the 
         <div class="quote e61">pointy-bracket-date-close-pointy-bracket</div> thing in a tag set.  Date element?  I don’t believe this tag set has a date element.
         And I did a lot of digging around and searching until I figured out that the thing
         in email that was spelled 
         <div class="quote e62">pointy-bracket-d-a-t-e-close-pointy-bracket</div> was an attribute.  Because I didn’t look for it there!!  Surrounding things with
         pointy-brackets in our world has a well-established meaning.  The guy in email lost
         a lot of credibility because he spelled the name of an attribute with pointy-brackets
         around it.
      </div>
      <div class="para e63">Now, these are terms with well-established meanings.  What about when you’re working
         in the world where most of us are going to be talking at 
         <div class="emphasis e64" role="ital">Balisage</div> — a world where we don’t quite have well-established meanings?  Where the meanings
         drift over time?  Meanings of words change all the time.  I don’t mean necessarily
         technical terms or jargon, but in the real world.  For example, I’m old enough and
         picky enough to find it really irritating when people use the word 
         <div class="quote e65">decimate</div> to mean 
         <div class="quote e66">to do serious damage to</div> or 
         <div class="quote e67">totally destroy.</div>  That’s not what that word used to mean, and I’m enough of a curmudgeon to think
         it’s not what the word should mean.  But nonetheless when I listen to somebody giving
         a speech at a political rally and they say that something or other will decimate the
         economy, I know that they don’t really mean 
         <div class="quote e68">remove 10%</div> of it; they really mean it’s just awful.
      </div>
      <div class="para e69">Our technical terms do the same thing, and while I’m telling you to use technical
         terms correctly, I’m also warning you that that may not actually be possible.  What
         is the real meaning of a technical term?  The meaning of the first person who used
         it?  The popular meaning?  The current meaning?  The meaning in Wikipedia?  We’re
         going to encounter that issue a lot during this conference.  Imagine, if you will,
         a situation that several of you in this room who are speaking are going to encounter
         in the next few days:  You invented something.  You thought of something really clever.
         You coined a term for it — either you made up a new word or you borrowed a word somebody
         else was using.  (You can’t win; if you coin a new word — if you make up a new word
         — you’ll confuse people.  If you use a word that means something else in some other
         context for your new thing, you’ll confuse people, so, you know, there’s no winning.)
         But you came up with this new thing, you gave a couple conference talks about it,
         you published a couple of papers about it — it’s clever, it’s new, it’s yours — and
         now somebody else is talking about this same idea.  Do you get bent out of shape if
         they don’t use your word?  Or do you get bent out of shape if they do use your word?
         What if what they’re talking about isn’t exactly what you were talking about; it’s
         sorta similar.  Do you want them to use your word for something sorta similar?  Or
         do you want them not to use your word because it isn’t your thing?  What if their
         work was based on your work?  You want them to cite your paper — do you want them
         to use your terminology?  They’re not using it 
         <div class="quote e70">right</div> because they’ve moved in some direction that probably isn’t the direction you were
         going to move.  What if they invented the same thing at the same time more-or-less-approximately,
         but they’re not crediting you because they figured it out too?  Is there such a thing
         as simultaneous invention?  Yes.  Would it be polite if they cited your paper too?
         Yes.  Do they have to use your vocabulary?  Think about it.  I don’t know.  What if
         they’re using your term just plain incorrectly?  Is this a good thing because people
         are going to call attention to your work too?  Is this a bad thing because they’re
         doing it wrong?  I’m not sure what the answer is, but I do think you want to think
         about it.  And it’s the kind of thing we’re going to be seeing at 
         <div class="emphasis e71" role="ital">Balisage</div>.
      </div>
      <div class="para e72">There are few other things I would like to say about 
         <div class="emphasis e73" role="ital">Balisage</div>.  As far as I’m concerned, you’re my guest.  You’re here — you’re my guest.  And
         so is everybody else in this room.  And what that means is:  You must treat everyone
         else who is here as one of my guests.  I do not want anybody being negative at anybody.
         I said that a couple of years ago at this conference and thought, 
         <div class="quote e74">That’s kinda preachy and prissy, and why on earth do I need to say that?</div>  And then the next year I didn’t say it, and several people said, 
         <div class="quote e75">We really need to be reminded of that.</div>  I thought about it, and somebody said, 
         <div class="quote e76">Did you hear that guy at the microphone who said to a speaker, `That’s the stupidest
            idea I’ve ever heard!’?
         </div>  I said, 
         <div class="quote e77">Oh.  Yeah.  I did hear that.</div>  Let’s not do that.  No personal attacks.  By the way, 
         <div class="quote e78">that’s the stupidest idea I’ve ever heard</div> is not about the idea — that’s a personal attack.  And don’t 
         <div class="quote e79">language</div> lawyer at me and say, 
         <div class="quote e80">No, no, it’s about the idea, not the person.</div>  It’s a personal attack, folks.  We don’t do that here.  
         <div class="quote e81">That idea won’t work because …</div> 
         <div class="quote e82">Have you thought of this?</div>  That’s talking about the idea.  
         <div class="quote e83">That’s the worst paper I’ve ever heard.</div>  If you have to say that, say it on the critique forms.  You know why it’s safe to
         say that on the critique forms?  They’re going to be edited before they go to the
         speakers.  Because some of you use very colorful language, and we’ll tone if down
         before passing it on.
      </div>
      <div class="para e84">Now, that doesn’t mean that I want you to sit carefully in your seats with your hands
         folded and behave like — I don’t know — some notion of how school children behave.
         I’ve never actually seen school children behave like that.  This is a lively environment.
         This is an environment in which, in my opinion, the more successful a talk is, the
         longer the line will be at the microphone of people who want either to ask the speaker
         a question or disagree with something the speaker said.  There will also be people
         who are inspired during talks to say either 
         <div class="quote e85">Yes!!</div> or 
         <div class="quote e86">Ooh!</div>  And if you have either of those sort of mono-syllabic comments to make where the
         point of it is the tone of voice and not the content, just shout.  However, if you
         really have something to say that involves words, use the microphone.  Even if you
         are sitting in one of the first two or three rows and the speaker will be able to
         hear you if you speak from your seat, the people behind you will not.
      </div>
      <div class="para e87">There are a few notions that we saw and that peer reviewers called out in some of
         the papers that were submitted to this conference.  They were rarely this bald, but
         there were some people who said, for example:  
         <div class="quote e88">If I don’t need it, you can’t have it.</div>  
         <div class="quote e89">There is this big complicated specification, three-quarters of which I don’t need
            in my environment, and therefore the way to make all of our lives easier is to eliminate
            the stuff I don’t need.
         </div>  Be careful when you’re saying, 
         <div class="quote e90">Nobody needs something because I don’t need it.</div>
      </div>
      <div class="para e91">We had several draft papers that included statements on the general order of 
         <div class="quote e92">Everybody doing XML does this</div> or 
         <div class="quote e93">Nobody in the XML world does that.</div>  If you say, 
         <div class="quote e94">Everybody I know in the XML world does this</div> or 
         <div class="quote e95">Everybody in my industry …</div> although you might want to make that 
         <div class="quote e96">Everybody in my industry that I know does this,</div> you’re on solid ground.  
         <div class="quote e97">I am not aware of anyone who needs something or other</div> — you’re fine.  But 
         <div class="quote e98">Everybody in the XML world does their analysis this way</div> or 
         <div class="quote e99">Nobody uses that specification</div> — it’s a good bet, you’re wrong.  (Well, with the possible exception of XLink.  Oh,
         you mean that somebody does use it?  Hmmmm.  Maybe there are no possible exceptions.)
      </div>
      <div class="para e100">A few other things that I want us to think about.  
         <div class="quote e101">If you have more data, you’re more important.</div>  
         <div class="quote e102">If you have more data, your problems are harder.</div>  
         <div class="quote e103">Any solution that works for people who have the maximum amount of data and resources
            is the right answer.
         </div>  Or conversely, 
         <div class="quote e104">Any solution that cannot be implemented by a person with good intentions but no programming
            background and no budget at all doesn’t work.
         </div>  
         <div class="quote e105">If I can’t do it with what I know for free, it can’t be done.</div>  Let’s not go there either.
      </div>
      <div class="para e106">And one of the ones that I think we’re likely to spend a lot of energy on:  
         <div class="quote e107">If some people who used to use XML stop using XML and do something else, then they
            must be stopped, or XML will be a failure.
         </div>  That’s almost as sensible as 
         <div class="quote e108">If everybody on the planet doesn’t use XML and know that they are using XML, then
            XML is a failure.
         </div>  You’ve got some funny notions, folks.  If something works for some users for some
         applications, it is valuable and useful and interesting to talk about at 
         <div class="emphasis e109" role="ital">Balisage</div>.  If something is important to some users and it is something that you don’t need
         now, that doesn’t mean you won’t need it in the future.  For example, we have, to
         me, a surprising number of papers that will talk about JSON this week.  The big threat
         to XML, right???  Woooooo!  But then again I remember when XML was the big threat
         to Java, which never made any sense to me; sliced bread is not a threat to toasters.
         JSON is not a threat to XML, and the fact that there are environments in which some
         technology other than XML might meet some people’s needs does not make XML obsolete
         or useless or necessarily in need of changing so those people will use it.  Nor do
         those people need to be bullied into using XML because XML is better than anything
         else.
      </div>
      <div class="para e110">We’ll also hear people saying that about 
         <div class="quote e111">overlap</div>.  Everbody knows that in XML, structures don’t overlap, and therefore you don’t need
         
         <div class="quote e112">overlap</div> and therefore we should not talk about it at conferences.  Right?  Except sometimes
         those rules get a little tight, and sometimes there are things that don’t quite work
         in that world.  That dirty little secret is something we’re allowed to talk about
         here.
      </div>
      <div class="para e113">We’re also allowed to talk about other things that don’t quite work and don’t quite
         fit and haven’t been quite solved.  That’s what we do here.  And that is what I think
         it’s time for us to start talking about.  Welcome to 
         <div class="emphasis e114" role="ital">Balisage</div>!
