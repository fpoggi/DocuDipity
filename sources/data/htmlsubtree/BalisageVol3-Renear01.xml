               imply that documents are extensional entities that cannot undergo changes such as
               editing or revision. In other domains as well, such as textual criticism and library
               science, one can also find notions of text or document that are similarly difficult
               to reconcile with modification. We describe the problem and sketch some possible
               resolutions. Although the issues are conceptual and foundational the practical
               significance is real. Formal representation in logic-based ontology languages,
               increasingly important in information management, requires that familiar idioms,
               however serviceable and entrenched, be converted to expressions that support literal
               interpretation.

         <div class="title e39">The Problem</div>
         <div class="para e40">Document modification seems to be routine and widespread. Editing is a familiar
            practice to almost everyone, and revision a fundamental feature of publishing workflows.
            Yet document modification would appear to be an illusion. Common accounts of what
            documents are seem to imply that documents cannot undergo genuine modification.
         </div>
         <div class="para e41">The W3C XML specification defines an XML Document as a string that meets certain
            formal constraints. Strings are mathematical constructs that are defined, ultimately,
            in
            set theoretic terms. They are therefore purely extensional entities constrained by
            the
            axiom of extensionality, common to all standard set theories. As a consequence, strings
            have all of their non-relational properties essentially and cannot be altered or
            modified in any way. Although we can of course identify functions that map one string
            to
            another, the existence of such functions does not, by itself, provide a explanation
            of
            what constitutes the modification of a document. 
         </div>
         <div class="para e42">This consequence is not unique to the definition of a document as a string. Familiar
            alternative definitions fare no better. Documents (in the relevant sense) have been
            defined as graphs, relations, Ordered Hierarchies of Content Objects [
            <div class="xref e43" linkend="derose90"></div>], and sentences in formal logic [
            <div class="xref e44" linkend="renear06"></div>].
            But these are all also extensional entities: graphs, relations, tuples, and strings
            all
            have mathematical definitions in virtue of which they are kinds of sets. Nor is the
            problem particular to formal definitions that make explicit use of mathematical
            constructs. Many of the concepts of document (or text) used in library science, textual
            criticism, aesthetics, and other fields appear, upon examination, to be similarly
            problematic.

      </div><a name="ASimpleExample:TheVeronaSentenceANCHOR" href="#mainContainerTitleTOC" class="anchor">toc</a><div class="section e45">
         <div class="title e46">A Simple Example: The Verona Sentence</div>
         <div class="para e47">The problem can be made introduced with a simple example that makes no explicit use
            of
            mathematical or philosophical notions [
            <div class="xref e48" linkend="renear08"></div>].
         </div>
         <div class="para e49">Consider the sentence "I remember Verona." Let this be the first sentence of the first
            chapter of a draft of a novel.
         </div>
         <div class="para e50">Suppose that the author decides to edit that sentence and revises it to read: "I
            remember, but dimly, Verona".
         </div>
         <div class="para e51">It is natural to say that the first sentence of the chapter has been changed, that
            it
            is now longer. But exactly 
            <div class="emphasis e52" role="ital">what</div> has been changed?
            
            <div class="emphasis e53" role="ital">What</div> has become longer? The new first sentence, "I
            remember, but dimly, Verona", has not changed. That sentence has never consisted of
            fewer than five words. The original sentence, "I remember Verona", has not changed
            either. It is not now longer than it was; it still consists of three words. It is
            true
            that "I remember, but dimly, Verona" is a longer sentence than "I remember Verona",
            but
            it did not 
            <div class="emphasis e54" role="ital">become</div> a longer sentence than "I remember
            Verona" -- it has always been a longer sentence than "I remember Verona".
         </div>
         <div class="para e55">One might attempt to address the problem by shifting the scope of attention and
            propose that it is the text of the chapter that has changed. However, the chapter
            as a
            whole is simply another, if longer, textual entity, and has the same identity
            conditions. So the puzzle will arise again. The chapter has been revised, but neither
            the new text nor the original text undergoes any change during this process. And the
            same argument may be made for the entire text of the novel.
         </div>
         <div class="para e56">In short: While it is natural to speak of sentences or other textual entities changing
            when they are edited or revised, it appears that these entities themselves do not
            really
            change. So what does change? 
         </div>
         <div class="para e57">The Verona puzzle may feel like a parlor trick, but the significance is real enough:
            we do not have a clear conceptual understanding of what is happening when documents
            are
            modified. Of course truth values can be correctly assigned to modification sentences
            such as "The sentence was changed", but only if we treat these sentences as idioms,
            as
            we do sentences like "The average plumber has 3.2 children". Such sentences do not
            have
            compositional semantics or support existential instantiation and there is often little
            systematic guidance for their interpretation. Up until now we have largely avoided
            these
            problems, relying ad hoc solutions and human intervention. But the increasingly formal
            nature of new semantic approaches to information management and publishing, and the
            continuing minimization of human intervention, will inevitably require us to more
            systematically to develop robust literal interpretations of fundamental concepts.

               Searle's work [

               count as social objects. Barry Smith has defended a theory of social objects that
               allows social objects to exist even without natural objects that "count as" or
               constitute them [
               <div class="xref e123" linkend="smith03"></div>]. Another related perspective is Brian
               Cantwell Smith's notion of holding objects in the "middle distance" [

            <div class="para e125">Against the social object strategy: The social object strategy preserves the
               intuition that documents are modifiable, but at a considerable cost. First, it
               requires an ontologically challenging entity, social objects that cannot be
               identified with physical objects, abstract objects, or even mental states. There is
               also a corresponding new distinctive metaphysical relation as well: 
               <div class="emphasis e126" role="ital">constitution</div>, the relationship that obtains between the
               social object and the different strings that constitute that object at different
               times. That this relation cannot be simple identity is evident from the fact that
               it
               is not transitive: while the document qua social object may be constituted by one
               string at one time and a different string at another time, this does not imply that
               the two strings are themselves identical. Searle's notion of "counting as", if
               applied to social objects, may avoid some of the traditional problems with
               constitution, but it will still be hard to reconcile social objects with a
               naturalistic view of the world.

               created with each document modification. This seems peculiar, contrary to general
               notion of strings, and generally difficult to reconcile with a naturalistic view of
               the world. Consider the string "13571". Was that string created? How did that
               happen? And when? Can it be destroyed? Can it be re-created? Unless strings are
               material objects the conceptual apparatus of creation and destruction seems entirely
               metaphorical.

               <div class="emphasis e143" role="ital">selected</div> for attention. When we say that a
               document has been modified we mean that a different string has been selected for the
               purpose at hand by some particular person or persons. The physical infrastructure
               of
               analog or digital document development and publishing, in combination with social
               conventions and practices, is a system for recording and communicating which string
               is currently distinguished in this way.
            </div>
            <div class="para e144">Against the Selection Strategy: The selection strategy identifies documents with
               already existing strings. But this seems strange. Either these already existing
               strings came into existence at some point in the past or they have always existed.
               If the former then this strategy has no advantages over the new document strategy;
               it must still somehow account for how strings can come into existence, from what
               materials and in what causal circumstances. But if the latter, if strings have
               always existed, then assuming only that the further requirements for being a
               document are non-contingent (such as matching a production) we will have documents,
               and not just strings, existing eternally -- apparently even before cognitive agents.
               This seems peculiar.

            <div class="para e148">Strictly speaking the strategy we are about to take up denies only the third
               assertion of the triad (documents can be modified). However because it proposes a
               substantially new definition of document it has much in common with strategies that
               deny the first assertion and so we are placing it in a separate category.
            </div>
            <div class="para e149">The 
               <div class="emphasis e150" role="bold">String-in-a-role Strategy:</div> This strategy
               holds that a document is a string in a particular communicative role. The string
               itself may be an uncreated and pre-existing entity, but the strings which are
               documents need not always have been documents. Being a document is a property that
               strings have only in particular contingent social/linguistic situations. So on this
               account 
               <div class="emphasis e151" role="ital">documents</div> have not always existed, even
               though documents are strings, and strings have always existed. This is because while
               a string which is a document has always existed, that string has not always been a
               document -- a string becomes a document only in the appropriate social
               circumstances.
            </div>
            <div class="para e152">Although this strategy, like the strategies that reject the first assertion of the
               triad (documents are strings) involves a new approach to the definition of document,
               it affirms rather than rejects the first assertion of the triad. After all, if a
               document is a string in a communicative role, then a document is a string. However,
               the string-in-a-role definition of document is unlike definitions such as the one
               in
               the XML specification in that it places a contingent rather than necessary
               constraint on strings satisfying the definition. If a document is defined as a
               string with certain purely formal constraints (as it is in the XML specification,
               where it must match a particular production in a grammar), then the things which are
               in fact documents are documents necessarily. This is because not only is it
               impossible for a string to cease to be a string or have been anything other than a
               string, it is also impossible for a string that matches a particular production to
               have ever failed to match that production or to fail to match that production in the
               future. 
            </div>
            <div class="para e153">According to the string-in-a-role strategy the property of being a document is
               what Guarino and Welty refer to as a "rigid" property [
               <div class="xref e154" linkend="guarino00"></div>].
               Guarino and Welty define rigidity using modal logic and model theory, but the basic
               idea is simple: a property is rigid if and only if nothing that has that property
               could have failed to have that property, or could come to lose that property, (and
               still exist). For example, 
               <div class="emphasis e155" role="ital">being a person</div> is rigid
               because the things that are persons could not have been anything but persons and
               cannot cease to be persons (although they can cease to be). But 
               <div class="emphasis e156" role="ital">being a student</div> is not rigid because the things that are
               students (i.e. persons) might not have been students and can cease to be students
               (without ceasing to be). According to Guarino and Welty rigid properties indicate
               
               <div class="emphasis e157" role="ital">types,</div> fundamental kinds of things, while
               non-rigid properties indicate 
               <div class="emphasis e158" role="ital">roles</div> that things of
               some particular type may enter into. On this view a document is not a type of thing,
               but a role that things of some type or other have in particular contingent circumstances.

         <div class="para e166">There is much more to be said pro and con on the strategies we have described here,
            and there possibly better strategies to consider. We have intended only to suggest
            some
            of the possibilities. Formal representation and inferencing is increasingly widespread
            and increasingly important, and systematically making information computationally
            available in logic-based ontology languages requires literal interpretation. Human
            beings may effectively communicate with natural language sentences such as "The document
            was edited" or "The average plumber has 3.2 children". But to support inferencing
            in the
            semantic web environment these idioms must be represented formally in languages that
            rely on compositional semantics, existential instantiation, and valid deductive
            consequences.

            It
            isn't clear exactly how to finish the job, and yet it is clear that some of our most
            familiar -- and effective -- ways of conceptualizing our domain will revised if we
            continue along this path. Particularly troublesome is the prospect that the revisions
            anticipated will add not only complexity in design and use, but increase computational
            complexity as well. As we have suggested elsewhere "denormalized" ontologies may be
            more
            appropriate for much of the practical work ahead.
