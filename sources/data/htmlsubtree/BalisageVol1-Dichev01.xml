         <div class="abstract e6">
            <div class="para e7">This paper addresses the issue of
               sharing and integrating data across RDF and
               Topic Map representations. The novel
               aspect of tackling the RDF - Topic Maps
               interoperability
               problem is the attempt to identify the
               right balance between the following key aspects:
               (i) semantics-preserving data translation;
               (ii) completeness of the translation; (iii)
               pragmatics
               and usability of the translation. The
               proposed strategy towards achieving this goal is
               based on
               exploiting the ontological correspondence
               between RDF and Topic Maps.  The design focus is
               placed
               on a translation respecting the meaning
               and the readability of the RDF - Topic Maps
               translation.
               The paper analyzes the feasibility of the
               interoperability task, presents some requirements
               derived
               from this analysis, and proposes a method
               for RDF - Topic Maps translation. The proposed
               method is
               implemented as a plug-in of the TM4L topic maps editor.

         <div class="para e55">Data availability is no longer a
            major problem given the sheer volume of
            information on the web
            and the advances in information retrieval
            and indexing technology.  The lack of
            interoperability at the
            model, metadata, and data levels presents
            the major barrier to knowledge and data sharing
            [
            <div class="xref e56" linkend="ref33"></div>].
            Many-to-many data-interchange media, such
            as the web, pose new requirements for sharing and
            exchange of
            data. One of the most challenging among
            them is the ability to make use of information
            outside of its
            structural origin. This requirement
            implies data interchange not only on a syntactic,
            but also on a
            semantic and structural level.  
         </div>
         <div class="para e57">The presented work was motivated by
            the idea of creating a tool that allows effective
            reuse and
            integration of existing Topic Maps (TM)
            and RDF data. Similarly to previous efforts in
            this direction
            [
            <div class="xref e58" linkend="ref15"></div>], [
            <div class="xref e59" linkend="ref18"></div>], [
            <div class="xref e60" linkend="ref21"></div>],
            [
            <div class="xref e61" linkend="ref3"></div>],
            [
            <div class="xref e62" linkend="ref10"></div>], [
            <div class="xref e63" linkend="ref28"></div>], we aim at enhancing the
            interoperability between
            the two models by providing
            translation bridging the two frameworks,
            instead of forcing applications “to speak the
            same language”.
            The aim is similar but the proposed
            approach is different.  In previous works, the
            mapping strategies
            are guided by the observed equivalence
            between the Topic Maps subject and RDF resource
            concepts. Such a
            strategy implies some sort of
            subject-centered translation. In contrast, our
            approach is based on the
            ontological correspondence between RDF and
            Topic Maps.  Diverse and interesting similarities
            can be
            captured based on correspondences between
            the ways we relate things rather than on the
            correspondences
            between things alone. Therefore, our
            approach implies identifying similarities not
            only between concepts,
            but also between how statements about
            those concepts are asserted. Such similarities
            make the translation
            between the two models more predictable.
            This is a principal point in our translation
            approach, which
            proposes to divide the concepts to be
            translated into overlapping and non-overlapping
            categories and
            then to conquer them by translating, with
            a correspondingly focused and general
            translation.  
         </div>
         <div class="para e64">This type of work is related to
            ontology and metadata mapping [
            <div class="xref e65" linkend="ref13"></div>],[
            <div class="xref e66" linkend="ref14"></div>],
            [
            <div class="xref e67" linkend="ref24"></div>],[
            <div class="xref e68" linkend="ref31"></div>]. Metadata mapping,
            in particular, involves an identification
            of equivalent or nearly equivalent metadata
            elements within
            different metadata schemas. In contrast to
            metadata mapping, translation between
            independently developed
            RDF and Topic Maps data can not be
            accomplished by mapping between two vocabularies.
            The mapping mechanism
            is more complex because it involves mapping
            between frameworks with extensible vocabularies
            implying that
            one-to-one correspondence is not generally possible.
         </div>
         <div class="para e69">A critical question regarding this type
            of translation is whether all concepts of the
            source language
            can be appropriately translated to some in
            the target language. Assuming that a complete
            translation is
            possible, a derived question is whether all
            concepts from the source language should be
            translated to the
            target language at any price. At first, it
            seems that complete and accurate translation from
            the source to
            the target language (if possible) should be
            preferable to the translation skipping or
            transforming the
            meaning of some concepts. However, the
            answer, in fact, depends on the purpose of the
            translation and on
            the selected criteria. The translation as a
            process and objective involves two aspects:
            semantic and
            pragmatic [
            <div class="xref e70" linkend="ref35"></div>]. They
            correspond to the following questions: Is a
            concept from the source language expressible
            in the target language? Is a concept
            translated from the source language useful in the
            target language? 
         </div>
         <div class="para e71">The technical and pragmatic aspects of
            the translation reflected by the above questions
            are equally
            important. They also imply a variable
            strategy. Instead of a complete and faithful
            translation in some cases
            it might be better to chose a translation
            preserving the meaning of some concepts and
            modifying (slightly)
            the meaning of some other in order to match
            them to predefined concepts in the target
            language. The translation
            strategy of the source concepts should not
            be independent from their role in the target. For
            example, extending
            a language to accommodate a foreign concept
            is a challenging task from a usability
            perspective. The following
            observations indicate that the set of
            concepts satisfying the first question is not
            necessarily equivalent to
            the set of concepts satisfying the second one:

            (iii) pragmatics and usability of the

            RDF - Topic Maps
            mapping, preserving the ontological
            vocabulary is not a required property of our
            translation approach.
            Instead, the basic requirements are guided
            by pragmatic and semantic considerations. As a
            result, the focus
            is on a translation respecting the meaning,
            the utility and the readability of the translated

            of the analysis
            we propose a method for RDF - Topic Maps
            (RDF2TM) translation. In contrast to metadata
            mapping, a general
            RDF2TM mapping goes beyond the simple data
            interoperability, since it involves exchange of
            conceptual knowledge
            within and across the corresponding Topic
            Maps and RDF models. The paper starts with a
            conceptual discussion
            of problems in RDF - Topic Maps
            interoperability, which motivated the design
            requirements of our translation.

               The latter can further be divided into
               differences among the things that are described
               and differences in
               the way things are described. The problems
               associated with the semantic interoperability
               between RDF and
               Topic Maps are mostly due to the differences
               in their original assumption of how the world is
               modeled.  These
               differences are passed to the corresponding
               modeling frameworks, which directly affects the
               syntax and the
               descriptive capability of each. It also
               affects the mapping between the two models. The
               fact that RDF and
               Topic Maps differ in representation,
               structure, and vocabulary leads to a great
               multiplicity of matching
               alternatives. In general, an RDF2TM mapping
               process can not be defined by one-to-one matching
               relationships
               between the source and target concepts.
               Typically it involves one-to-many, many-to-one,
               and one-to-none
               relationships. This type of matching
               ambiguity may turn into semantic inconsistency
               that is not resolvable
               without specific domain information.  Such
               inconsistencies occur because the source model:
               (i) differs in
               compositional granularity from the target,
               (ii) has extensible vocabulary along with the
               target and
               (iii) contains concepts that are irrelevant
               according to the target ontological vocabulary.

            <div class="para e147">but with an equivalent meaning to the

               associations differ
               in compositional granularity from the RDF
               properties. Their expression involves concepts
               such as association
               type and role types coupled with
               role-playing topics. The 
               <div class="emphasis e148" role="ital">Role player: Role type</div>
               constructs of the Topic Maps association do
               not have a matching counterpart in the RDF
               properties (i.e.
               one-to-none matching). In such cases there
               are three alternatives: to disregard all role
               players in the
               translation, to translate them into a
               predefined RDF construct with a similar meaning
               or to perform a
               semantic preserving translation into RDF
               construct intended to serve as an RDF encoding of
               the TM role
               types and role players. Even if we decide to
               skip the Topic Maps role types translation, we
               still have
               to decide how to relate role players to the
               subject and object of the RDF based-on property.
               This will
               transform the directionally neutral Topic
               Maps association into uni-directional RDF
               properties. A closer
               look at Topic Maps association
               specifications reveals that both role players
               must be topics (they cannot be
               strings) while the object of the RDF
               based-on property can be any resource. For
               example, in one RDF document
               the object of the ext:based-on property may
               refer to a web page describing Xpointer (single
               resource)
               while in another RDF document the object of
               the ext:based-on property may refer to the
               Xpointer concept
               with a reference to book chapter divided
               into sections by relevant RDF properties

               association. Similar
               arguments also apply to user defined
               associations/properties such as based-on. However
               the Topic Maps and
               RDF extensibility makes finding a user
               defined property with equivalent semantics a
               challenging task.
            </div>
            <div class="para e167">In contrast, a translation of source
               content, which includes concepts that do not
               exist in the target
               model, may result in a redundant set of
               data, a set that remains unused by the agents
               using the target
               representation. Indeed, we can translate a
               Topic Maps binary association with role types and
               role players
               into RDF by mapping it into a composition of
               RDF properties that preserve the role concept.
               Thus, it is
               possible to define a translation that
               captures the semantics of a TM association.
               However, the interpretation
               of the corresponding RDF composition
               embodying the role concept is conveyed by an
               external agreement for RDF.
               More importantly, semantic consistency does
               not imply intentional consistency. An agent
               reading the target
               may be unable to grasp the role concepts as
               intended in the source. As a result, the original
               intention
               assigned to association roles may be lost
               despite their faithful translation. To make this
               example more
               specific, consider a user-defined Topic Maps
               association, 
               <div class="emphasis e168" role="ital">employment</div>,
               involving two roles, 
               <div class="emphasis e169" role="ital">employer</div> and 
               <div class="emphasis e170" role="ital"> employee</div>.
               The two roles can be translated into
               matching RDF constructs participating in the
               translated
               
               <div class="emphasis e171" role="ital">employment</div>
               association.  For example, for each role in the
               
               <div class="emphasis e172" role="ital"> employment</div>
               association we can include a statement
               whose property corresponds to the role type
               (viz. 
               <div class="emphasis e173" role="ital">employer</div>
               and
               
               <div class="emphasis e174" role="ital">employee</div>);
               its value is a property with predicate
               
               <div class="emphasis e175" role="ital">member</div> that
               references the role player, where referencing is
               done
               through an additional (e.g. 
               <div class="emphasis e176" role="ital">referencedBy </div>) property.
               Obviously, this will increase the complexity
               of the resulted translation while
               decreasing its readability.  More
               importantly, despite their presence in the
               resulting RDF encoding, the
               constructs corresponding to the employer and
               employee roles may remain unused because they
               correspond to
               concepts defined outside of RDF - the
               existing RDF applications are designed with no
               assumptions relating
               to query, search, display, etc., association roles. 
            </div>
            <div class="para e177">It is even more challenging to
               pragmatically integrate the TM contextual roles
               (e.g. when a
               person playing a role of 
               <div class="emphasis e178" role="ital">husband</div> in one context is
               playing a role of
               
               <div class="emphasis e179" role="ital"> father</div> in
               another context) in an RDF setting, ensuring
               their practical
               utilization. When a topic map user applies a
               scope to a particular statement, he does that
               with certain
               intent. The scope concept with meaning
               provided by the Topic Maps data model is
               designated to capture this
               intention. Since there is no corresponding
               term (and meaning) in the RDF vocabulary, this
               intention can not
               be passed to the target. A possible approach
               for overcoming such problems is to extend the RDF
               vocabulary
               with terms for naming given RDF compositions
               that correspond to particular Topic Maps concepts
               (e.g. 
               <div class="emphasis e180" role="ital">rdf:scope</div>).  However, we
               believe that we should not target a translation
               that enforces or assumes that RDF users and
               applications should “speak Topic Maps”.

            <div class="para e181">Translating in the opposite direction,
               from RDF to Topic Maps, demonstrates slightly
               different problems
               [
               <div class="xref e182" linkend="ref10"></div>].
               Consider, for example, a general RDF
               property, relating two resources identified by
               their URIs. It can be
               mapped to either a TM binary association or
               a TM occurrence. The correct mapping of the RDF
               property to a
               Topic Maps format depends on the intended
               meaning of the property (e.g. 
               <div class="emphasis e183" role="ital">employment</div>
               vs. 
               <div class="emphasis e184" role="ital">seeAlso</div>). On the  other
               hand, properties such as
               
               <div class="emphasis e185" role="ital">rdf:type</div> or
               
               <div class="emphasis e186" role="ital">rdfs:label</div> allow
               us to map
               them unambiguously  to Topic Maps
               expressions. The mapping in this particular case
               is enabled by the existing
               
               <div class="emphasis e187" role="ital">rdf:type</div>
               and 
               <div class="emphasis e188" role="ital">rdfs:label</div>
               semantics
               in the source language. However,
               non-standard properties, such as 
               <div class="emphasis e189" role="ital">rdf:is-described-by</div>,
               
               <div class="emphasis e190" role="ital">rdf:plays</div>
               or, 
               <div class="emphasis e191" role="ital">rdf:exists</div>,
               do not carry predefined semantics and thus
               can not be mapped based on any logical ground.
               RDF does not make
               any assumption about their meaning except
               that they relate two resources - one playing a
               role of subject and
               the other a role of object. In this case a
               semantic mapping to Topic Maps terms would
               require a significant
               human involvement. If the property 
               <div class="emphasis e192" role="ital">rdf:is-described-by</div>
               denotes a relationship
               with an information resource that is
               pertinent to and enlightens a given subject, then
               this property should be
               translated to a TM occurrence, otherwise it
               should be translated to a TM binary association.
               Note that a
               complete and accurate mapping will
               require additional decisions to be made
               about the occurrence type and the role types of
               the association in
               each of the corresponding decision steps. In
               a situation like that, human involvement can not
               be eliminated
               because a correct property translation will
               require an understanding of the context of the
               property, so its
               intended meaning and the resources it
               involves can be captured. These distinctive
               features of the two models
               and the differences in the compositional
               granularity result in a mapping ambiguity and the
               need of an
               additional vocabulary, such as RTM [
               <div class="xref e193" linkend="ref10"></div>], [
               <div class="xref e194" linkend="ref23"></div>],
               for explicitly
               defining external meaning and intentions.

            <div class="title e196">Design Requirements</div>
            <div class="para e197">Based on the above observations, we
               focus on a translation that respects the meaning
               while maximizing
               the usability of the translation result. To
               achieve this we exploit the ontological
               similarities between the
               models, which also allow natural integration
               of the translated expressions into the target
               formalism. As an
               additional requirement, we chose not to
               support guided translation [
               <div class="xref e198" linkend="ref10"></div>],
               [
               <div class="xref e199" linkend="ref29"></div>], [
               <div class="xref e200" linkend="ref30"></div>].  Thus, we assume that the
               source model is not annotated with specific
               information for the purpose of guiding the
               translation. This kind
               of annotation presumes familiarity with both
               models. It is typically done manually and is a
               costly exercise.
               A further assumption is that sharing
               vocabularies across the two models is not
               required. Our opinion is that
               the purpose of any translation is to make
               translated concepts interpretable in terms of the
               native vocabulary
               and to allow users not knowing a foreign
               vocabulary to utilize it. In fact, the primary
               role of the translation
               is to make users independent of a foreign
               vocabulary. The above assumptions served as a
               starting point for
               identifying the key requirements of the translation.

               <div class="para e203">The basic idea driving the proposed
                  translation requirements is that RDF and Topic
                  Maps represent two models
                  that overlap to a certain extent in their
                  modeling capabilities. This overlapping is at an
                  ontological level.
                  It refers to similarities in the way things
                  are organized, e.g. similarities in the way
                  things are grouped into
                  classes and the way things are related to
                  each other, to properties or to pertinent
                  information resources in
                  both models. Any strategy for dealing with
                  overlapping concepts implies a decision about
                  what to do with
                  non-overlapping concepts. However, the
                  intuition is that of the total amount of
                  available RDF and Topic Maps
                  data 
                  <div class="emphasis e204" role="ital">the portion that

                     sharable information

               <div class="para e205">The examples discussed in section 2.2
                  illustrate some translation problems inherent for
                  extensible
                  frameworks such as RDF and Topic Maps.  In
                  such data models the vocabulary is not fixed, but
                  is open for
                  defining new terms for particular
                  application domains. A further complication is
                  that when the data models
                  differ in compositional granularity, the
                  recognition of coarser from finer structures in
                  general can not
                  be done at a syntax level.  
               </div>
               <div class="para e206">On the other hand, there are a number
                  of initiatives, such as Dublin Core [
                  <div class="xref e207" linkend="ref1"></div>],
                  [
                  <div class="xref e208" linkend="ref7"></div>], FOAF, etc., that
                  provide fixed vocabularies with well defined
                  meanings.  Another trend in the Semantic Web is
                  the rise of data
                  that commits to simple ontologies, like SKOS
                  [
                  <div class="xref e209" linkend="ref16"></div>], OBO and BIO. There are
                  also a number
                  of predefined properties
                  and classes in RDF, as well as associations
                  in Topic Maps. The predefined constructs provide
                  necessary
                  information for accurate mapping.  Since a
                  full automatic translation between RDF and Topic
                  Maps is not
                  feasible in general, one possibility is to
                  provide specialized translations among common
                  ontologies/schemas.
                  Here we can draw an analogy with natural
                  languages, where there is a variety of
                  specialized language
                  translations, such as in the technical,
                  medical, legal, and financial areas.  This
                  analogy suggests that
                  a certain accuracy of the translation can be
                  achieved with a specialized translation. Such
                  domain-specific
                  RDF2TM translations could cover a
                  significant portion of the RDF and Topic Maps
                  data on the Web. The
                  remaining (smaller) portion will be the
                  subject of generic translation.

                  Initiative (DCMI) and the corresponding dialect
                  under development from

                  To be consistent with the description of
                  overlapping concepts, we restrict the Topic Maps
                  binary associations
                  to associations with all-scopes.  As for
                  RDF, we assume that the properties relating the

         <div class="para e307">The purpose of defining overlapping
            concepts is to enable an RDF2TM translation that
            integrates generic
            with focused translation in a single system.
            The focused component of the translation is
            intended to deal
            with the constructs identified as
            “overlapping concepts”. This also includes
            metadata vocabularies expressed
            in both RDF and Topic Maps in accordance
            with recognized standards.  For such constructs
            the translation is
            supposed to yield a semantics-preserving and
            reversible translation (also referred sometimes
            as “overlapping
            translation”). The remaining constructs
            are subject to generic translation. We claim that
            such an approach
            will result in a translation with an increased pragmatic value.
         </div>
         <div class="para e308">A significant portion of the
            information in the Semantic Web comes in three
            forms: metadata, taxonomies,
            and lightweight ontologies. (Some authors
            argue that most of the Semantic Web is metadata
            [
            <div class="xref e309" linkend="ref35"></div>].) This means
            that

            metadata
            form a vocabulary with a key role in the
            Semantic Web. If we enable a lossless and
            faithful-to-the-original-intention
            translation even only for the data expressed by
            this “core vocabulary”,
            that will already be a contribution to the RDF-TM interoperability.

               map to the domain and which one to the range
               of the property is arbitrary. The lack of
               predetermined mapping
               reflects the fact that, the TM role types
               play a neutral role in the associations and any
               decision of how to
               map them to the domain and range will have
               equal effect on the translation. For example, one
               possible
               translation of the association 
               <div class="emphasis e345" role="ital">employment(Christo:employee,

               into an RDF property may result in an RDF

               <div class="emphasis e346" role="ital">employment</div> with domain

               and range 
               <div class="emphasis e348" role="ital">employer</div>.
               This translation generates the property
               
               <div class="emphasis e349" role="ital">employment</div> that
               applies to instances of
               the class 
               <div class="emphasis e350" role="ital">employee</div> and the values of
               the 
               <div class="emphasis e351" role="ital">employment</div>
               property are instances of the class 
               <div class="emphasis e352" role="ital">employer</div>.
               The other alternative
               will generate an RDF property 
               <div class="emphasis e353" role="ital">employment</div> with domain
               
               <div class="emphasis e354" role="ital">employer</div>
               and range 
               <div class="emphasis e355" role="ital">employee</div>, which
               means that the property 
               <div class="emphasis e356" role="ital">employment</div> now applies to
               instances of the
               class 
               <div class="emphasis e357" role="ital">employment</div> and the values
               of the property are instances of the class
               
               <div class="emphasis e358" role="ital">employee</div>.
               Since the Topic Maps associations are
               directionally neutral,
               there is no danger of reversing the
               directionality  of the origin. Instead, we are
               fixing it. As Topic Maps
               do not assume any directionality, the names
               of the associations are typically articulated by
               a direction-neutral
               terms (e.g. 
               <div class="emphasis e359" role="ital">employment</div>).  Thus, the
               selection of the directionality does not
               affect the readability of the translation result.

            <div class="para e367">As stated earlier, the goal of this
               work is to foster the interchange of resources
               between RDF and Topic Maps.
               However, resource semantics is a broad term,
               which includes ontologies, metadata and
               instance-data. From the
               perspective of a librarian, cataloger or
               publisher, the Semantic Web is a metadata
               initiative. Therefore,
               successful interoperation requires an
               efficient strategy of how the standard categories
               of metadata relate to
               each other across RDF and Topic Maps
               formats.  The current web includes ontologies and
               metadata developed by
               different communities, such as Dublin Core
               metadata, FOAF etc. FOAF data currently makes the
               bulk of the
               Semantic Web information. Another trend is
               the rise of data that commits to simple
               ontologies like SKOS.
               The proposed approach combining translation
               of overlapping concepts with generic translation
               also incorporates
               methods specializing in specific metadata
               formats and dialect vocabularies. The inclusion
               of metadata into
               “overlapping concepts” is a reflection
               of the existence of both RDF and Topic Maps
               standards for encoding the
               included metadata. The standardization is an
               important component that integrates them in both
               languages and
               makes them overlapping concepts. For example
               DCMI currently has a Recommendation for
               expressing Dublin Core
               in RDF/XML [
               <div class="xref e368" linkend="ref1"></div>],
               [
               <div class="xref e369" linkend="ref20"></div>] and a new work item was
               recently approved
               by ISO for a Type 3 Technical Report on Expressing
               Dublin Core Metadata Using Topic Maps [
               <div class="xref e370" linkend="ref25"></div>], [
               <div class="xref e371" linkend="ref26"></div>].
               Assuming a two-format representation, the translation turns
               into a simple mapping between two standard
               encodings of the same metadata concepts.

            <div class="para e451">Semantics preserving translation is
               just one of the criteria guiding our translation
               strategy.
               As we mentioned earlier, the translation is
               intended to facilitate interoperability. The
               interoperability
               is measured by the ability of the two models
               to share common concepts. Concepts that have no
               match in the
               other model are among the ones that make the
               translation task difficult. For such concepts it
               is possible
               to provide translation generating
               semantically equivalent results such that even a
               user familiar with RDF
               and Topic Maps will hardly recognize and
               understand. Therefore, for non overlapping concepts
               we combine
               our criteria with 
               <div class="emphasis e452" role="ital">pragmatic
                  interoperability
               </div>. Pragmatic
               interoperability
               is used to measure the utilization of the
               translation result for achieving the agent’s
               goals.  It is in
               line with the intentional consistency as a
               measure of the occurrences when the intended
               meaning of the
               translation is in agreement with its actual
               interpretation from agents operating on the
               source. The proposed
               generic translation is intended to generate
               syntactically correct encoding in terms of the
               target model
               with minimal intentional inconsistency with
               respect to the original. All Topic Maps and RDF
               concepts that
               do not have corresponding counterparts in
               the other model (i.e. with no matching target
               concepts) are
               subject to generic translation.  Strictly
               speaking, the term “generic translation”
               refers to a combination
               of translations and transformations. The
               semantics of particular source concept may change
               its meaning
               when translated into the target model in
               order to make use of existing concepts with
               similar meaning
               instead of introducing new ones.
               Syntactically correct RDF (Topic Maps) output
               generated by the proposed
               approach does not always imply a compete
               translation. It is possible that part of the
               input changes both
               the representation and semantics during the translation.

            development was driven
            by two competing considerations: to provide
            a general purpose Topic Map editor and to create
            an e-learning
            environment providing authoring and browsing
            support for creating ontology-based learning
            content and for
            structuring digital repositories. To be
            consistent with the intended support and
            functionality, TM4L has
            extended the basic Topic Map vocabulary with
            predefined associations that are of specific
            importance to
            organizing digital collections. The
            vocabulary supported by TM4L can be viewed as a
            light Topic Map dialect.
            The translation tool being a plug-in to TM4L
            interprets the TM4L (extended) vocabulary as a

         <div class="para e569">The Web and Semantic Web visions are to
            share and reuse as much information as possible.
            A significant amount of work is being done
            to match different vocabularies.  In this area
            there have
            been considerable studies of approaches for
            ontology mapping where the concept of sharing and
            reusability
            has been interlinked to merging, alignment,
            articulation and fusion of ontologies [
            <div class="xref e570" linkend="ref13"></div>],
            [
            <div class="xref e571" linkend="ref14"></div>, [
            <div class="xref e572" linkend="ref31"></div>].
            In parallel, a number of different
            languages for ontology modeling have been
            proposed [
            <div class="xref e573" linkend="ref5"></div>],
            [
            <div class="xref e574" linkend="ref12"></div>], [
            <div class="xref e575" linkend="ref34"></div>], [
            <div class="xref e576" linkend="ref37"></div>],
            [
            <div class="xref e577" linkend="ref38"></div>],
            [
            <div class="xref e578" linkend="ref39"></div>].
            The problem of interoperation of
            heterogeneous data, based on different data
            models and modeling languages
            like RDF, Topic Maps, UML, etc. implies
            model-based methods aiming at model-level
            interoperability.
            As a result, a number of informal
            model-to-model mappings have been defined,
            including several proposals
            for mapping between Topic Maps and RDF
            [
            <div class="xref e579" linkend="ref2"></div>], [
            <div class="xref e580" linkend="ref5"></div>], [
            <div class="xref e581" linkend="ref6"></div>],
            [
            <div class="xref e582" linkend="ref7"></div>], [
            <div class="xref e583" linkend="ref8"></div>], [
            <div class="xref e584" linkend="ref9"></div>].
            Despite the emerging
            interest in the problem
            and the availability of some mapping tools,
            the reports on integration and reuse of data
            across the two
            models are scarce.
         </div>
         <div class="para e585">Moore [
            <div class="xref e586" linkend="ref18"></div>] was
            perhaps the first to propose a general strategy
            towards
            integration between Topic Maps
            and RDF. Lacher and Decker [
            <div class="xref e587" linkend="ref15"></div>] presented a model for mapping
            between the two
            standards by exploiting the
            “Topicmaps.net’s Processing Model for
            XTM 1.0” [
            <div class="xref e588" linkend="ref19"></div>].
            Technically, the conversion
            from Topic Maps to RDF is
            achieved by mapping the Topic Map graph
            model to an RDF graph. Another work in the area
            of TM2RDF mapping
            has been presented by Ogievetski. His
            starting point is also [
            <div class="xref e589" linkend="ref19"></div>]
            but he uses
            XSLT-based technology to
            translate any topic map document expressed
            in XTM into RDF abbreviated syntax. The relation
            between Topic Maps
            and RDF are discussed in detail by Garshol
            [
            <div class="xref e590" linkend="ref10"></div>], [
            <div class="xref e591" linkend="ref11"></div>]. The
            proposal in [
            <div class="xref e592" linkend="ref5"></div>] is the most mature work in the field,
            which describes how to convert information
            back and forth between the two technologies, how
            to convert schema
            information, and how to do queries across
            both information representations.  Some
            strategies and algorithms
            to achieve these goals are also presented
            along with a discussion of the problems of
            conversion between
            Topic Maps and RDF. A practical result of
            this work is the extension of the Ontopia’s
            Topic Map browser
            Omnigator (http://www.ontopia.net) with
            functionality allowing export/import between
            Topic Maps and RDF data.
         </div>
         <div class="para e593">An interesting work on integration
            between the Topic Maps and RDF technologies has
            been done as part
            of the META project, resulting in a set of
            tools for converting, editing and navigating
            metadata expressed
            in either language [
            <div class="xref e594" linkend="ref3"></div>].
            In this work the authors present their approach
            to the
            bidirectional conversion of RDF
            and Topic Maps and show how the use of
            schemas and standard predicates in RDF can lead
            to a flexible integration
            of the two languages. This integration is in
            the heart of the effort aimed at incorporating
            separate modules into
            a single editing and navigation tool that
            can be used for metadata collections expressed in
            both languages.

            can be found in [

            Despite the efforts
            and the proposed Guidelines
            for RDF/Topic Maps Interoperability [
            <div class="xref e597" linkend="ref29"></div>], however, there is no fully
            worked out and
            widely agreed upon solution
            to achieving data interoperability between RDF and Topic Maps yet.
         </div>
         <div class="para e598">Among the relevant works there are also
            the efforts for translating between Topic Maps
            and ontology
            models such as OWL and UML [
            <div class="xref e599" linkend="ref4"></div>], [
            <div class="xref e600" linkend="ref6"></div>].
         </div>
         <div class="para e601">While our work might seem close to the
            previous proposals on the surface, there are
            principal differences
            stemming from the different perception of
            the commonalities in both models. For example,
            the key correspondences
            between RDF and Topic Maps according to
            Garshol and Pepper [
            <div class="xref e602" linkend="ref10"></div>],
            [
            <div class="xref e603" linkend="ref29"></div>]
            are “subject (TM) — resource (RDF)” and
            “topic (TM) — node (RDF)”, which is
            reflected in their mapping strategy. In contrast,
            our approach builds on
            ontological correspondence.  Commonalities
            are better explicated in correspondences between
            how the things are
            related than in correspondences between the
            things alone. Thus, the “overlapping
            approach” reflects our
            understanding of the role of a shared
            ontological ground for meaning preserving
            translation. This sets the
            starting point in our translation strategy
            on overlapping concepts with reliance on existing
            and established
            vocabularies (e.g. RDF/RDFS, Dublin Core,
            and SKOS). The key factors of this strategy
            include minimizing the
            need of (i) a centralized agreement on new
            vocabulary terms emerging from the translation
            and (ii) an agreement
            of how to guide the translation process. 
         </div>
         <div class="para e604">In contrast to previous work,
            considering the completeness of translation as a
            key requirement, our
            starting point here was the question: Which
            Topic Maps constructs can be represented
            naturally in RDF (i.e.
            as RDF graphs) without RDF vocabulary
            extension? We also asked the reverse question:
            Which are the RDF
            constructs naturally expressible in Topic
            Maps? Since, generally, full automatic
            translation between RDF and
            Topic Maps is not possible, one possibility
            is to focus on semantic-preserving translation of
            the
            ontologies/schemas with common conceptual
            space. Translation satisfying such requirements
            can be achieved by
            identifying the overlapping conceptual
            domains of both models. Another difference is
            that our approach does
            not assume any annotation for guiding the
            translation. As a result, pre-translating human
            involvement is
            eliminated.
         </div>
         <div class="para e605">Among the most challenging tasks in the
            area of Topic Maps/RDF interoperability is the
            problem of
            translating the Topic Maps concept of scope.
            Except for Garshol [
            <div class="xref e606" linkend="ref10"></div>] no
            other
            works handle scope in satisfactory
            manner. The list of challenging problems
            also includes mapping variant names and RDF types
            such as containers
            and collections. None of the existing tools
            which provide translation between RDF and Topic
            Maps are able to
            handle containers and collections. The only
            approach for dealing with variant names is that
            of Ciancarini et
            al [
            <div class="xref e607" linkend="ref3"></div>], [
            <div class="xref e608" linkend="ref30"></div>].  They suggest translating
            variant names
            as compound concepts, which is quite unintuitive. Our
            strategy with non-overlapping concepts is
            similar to the way terms are traditionally
            translated from one
            language to another with a more limited
            vocabulary, namely, with a maximal reuse of the
            source vocabulary that
            is able to convey the intended meaning of the original.

         <div class="title e610">Conclusion</div>
         <div class="para e611">Taking the information from one
            representation scheme (such as Topic Maps) and
            extracting some
            or all of it for use in another scheme (such
            as RDF) is a difficult task [
            <div class="xref e612" linkend="ref2"></div>].
            In fact, few working tools
            exist to perform such transformations. One
            reason such conversions are difficult is that
            representation
            schemes differ in the basic structural
            constructs, granularity and schema constraints
            they provide for
            organizing information. As a consequence, straightforward, one-to-one
            mappings between schemes rarely exist.
         </div>
         <div class="para e613">In this context, the presented work is
            a contribution to the efforts aimed at improving
            the
            interoperability between Topic Maps and RDF.
            It has been carried on as a part of the TM4L
            project. The driving
            insight was to allow TM4L users to use RDF
            data and also enable RDF applications to use
            Topic Maps data produced
            with TM4L. During the implementation stage,
            the initial objective was broadened to create a
            general tool for
            RDF - Topic Maps translation. In the
            proposed approach, the balance between
            translation and transformation is
            in agreement with the target model. The type
            of translation applied to a particular construct
            depends on the
            level of overlapping between the
            corresponding concepts in the two models.  The
            idea is to provide a translation,
            from which the reader in the target is able
            to grasp the intended meaning of the original
            author. This implies
            a translation with acceptable loss of
            information when complete translation is
            impractical.
         </div>
         <div class="para e614">The proposed Topic Maps/RDF translation
            approach is implemented as a plug-in for TM4L.
            Although the
            illustrative examples mostly cover Topic
            Maps to RDF mapping, the actual implementation
            enables round tripping
            translation for a significant class of
            RDF/Topic Maps concepts. The idea is to enable
            Topic Maps users not
            only to merge existing Topic Maps data with
            RDF data but also to exploit some inference
            capability and then
            translate the results back into Topic Maps.
