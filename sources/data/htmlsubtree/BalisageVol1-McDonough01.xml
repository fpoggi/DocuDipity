            <div class="para e7">The past decade has seen the rise of both the XML standard and a variety of XML-based
               structural metadata schemas within the digital library community.  Both XML itself,
               and the metadata schemas developed by the digital library community can be considered
               as cases of sociotechnical artifacts, constructions that bear within them their designers'
               worldview of how people within the world should appropriate and use their technology.
               If we examine the metadata schemas produced by the digital library community, we find
               that the designers' inscription strongly favors local control over encoding practice
               to insuring interoperability between institutions.  If the goal of digital library
               interoperability is to be realized, schema designers will need to acknowledge the
               tension between local control and external connection using markup languages, and
               adjust their standard development efforts accordingly.

         <div class="para e27">Ten years after its endorsement by the World Wide Web Consortium, XML has achieved
            a high degree of adoption within numerous, disparate communities and in a vast range
            of application domains, from standards for electronic filing of federal income tax
            (
            <div class="xref e28" linkend="mcdo02"></div>) to user interface design (
            <div class="xref e29" linkend="mcdo01"></div>).   The digital library community has been an active and early adopter of XML, for
            use in structuring both content and  metadata.  The reasons for this rapid uptake
            of XML within the digital library community are familiar to anyone with experience
            in the world of markup languages:

            </div>
            For all of these reasons, XML-based content standards such as the Text Encoding Initiative
            (TEI) have seen wide adoption within the library community, and librarians have been
            actively engaged in the development of a number of XML-based metadata standards, including
            Encoded Archival Description (EAD), Metadata Object Description Schema (MODS), Metadata
            Authority Description Schema (MADS), Metadata Encoding and Transmission Standard (METS),
            Metadata for Images in XML (MIX), MPEG-21 Digital Item Declaration Language (DIDL),
            Open Archives Initiative Object Reuse and Exchange (OAI-ORE), Preservation Metadata
            Implementation Strategies (PREMIS) and many others.  XML is now widely used throughout
            the research library world, and is a fundamental part of the infrastructure developed
            within the digital library community over the past decade. 
         </div>
         <div class="para e43">Despite its success, however, XML has not lived up to many librarians' expectations
            within one area, that of interoperability.  Efforts to exchange information employing
            XML incarnations of descriptive metadata standards such as Dublin Core have fallen
            prey to a number of encoding and semantic inconsistencies (
            <div class="xref e44" linkend="mcdo05"></div>).  Perhaps more surprising is the failure of XML to ensure interoperability at a
            syntactic level.  Digital library developers have expected that shared use of an XML
            standard for structuring of content and metadata (what is commonly called "structural
            metadata" within the digital library community) would ensure content interoperability
            and provide a clean division between content and higher level tools and services designed
            to work with standardized encodings of that content (
            <div class="xref e45" linkend="mcdo09"></div>).  In practice, this goal has proved extraordinarily elusive. Experiments conducted
            by participants in the Library of Congress National Digital Infrastructure for Preservation
            Program (NDIIPP)

         </div>
         <div class="para e51">While some of the failures experienced by the Library of Congress NDIIPP tests were
            the result of incompatible repository infrastructure, others resulted from mismatched
            expectations regarding the appropriate use of METS, the XML format employed for the
            test.  DiLauro et al., discussing Johns Hopkins University's experience in the NDIIPP
            tests, state:
            
            <div class="popupBox e52">

                     <div class="para e53">Stanford commented after their ingest of the JHU archive that they had expected one
                        METS object for the entire archive. Because our approach resulted in many METS files
                        â on the order of the number of items in the archive â the Stanford ingest programs
                        experienced out-of-memory conditions. This situation may have been ameliorated had
                        they used the reference code provided by JHU; however, this will be an area that we
                        will look into for future archive ingest projects.
                     </div>
                     <div class="para e54">This matter points to a broader issue observed during the various import processes
                        of this phase. Though three of the four non-LC participants (including JHU) used METS
                        as part of their dissemination packages, each of our approaches was different. Clearly
                        there would be some advantage to working toward at least some common elements for
                        these processes (
                        <div class="xref e55" linkend="mcdo03"></div>).
                     </div>
                  </div>
               </div>
            </div>
            As DiLauro et al. allude, a critical difficulty for achieving interoperability using
            structural metadata standards such as METS is the level of flexibility they enable
            in structuring a description of an object.  As (
            <div class="xref e56" linkend="mcdo06"></div>) note in their discussion of using the MPEG-21 Digital Item Declaration Language
            during the NDIIPP test, it is possible to map a single object into multiple different
            encodings using MPEG-21, depending on the level of granularity you wish to employ
            in the description.  The same is true of METS and other, similar information packaging
            standards.  They each provide a structural grammar for the encoding of complex digital
            objects, and document authors can and do find a variety of different ways to talk
            about the structure of a single object using one of those grammars.
         </div>
         <div class="para e57">To date, the digital library community has treated these interoperability issues surrounding
            structural metadata standards as a technical problem demanding a technical solution.
            Most efforts to solve the interoperability problems around structural metadata have
            focused on the use of a profiling mechanism to further constrain the creation of instance
            documents conforming with the XML schema, sometimes in conjunction with a validation
            mechanism (such as Schematron) to test instance documents conformance with the additional
            requirements established in the profile (
            <div class="xref e58" linkend="mcdo07"></div>, 
            <div class="xref e59" linkend="mcdo08"></div>).  However, while these mechanisms may be successful in insuring interoperability
            within a narrowly defined local context, they are not in themselves any guarantee
            of interoperability at the scale envisioned by digital library projects such as Aquifer
            (
            <div class="xref e60" linkend="mcdo10"></div>), which hope to promote the ready exchange and interoperability of digital library
            content among a multitude of institutions.  The official METS profile registry already
            contains a variety of mutually incompatible profiles for similar types of objects.

            These goals convey some of the world view that XML's designer brought to bear in creating
            the technology.  It is clear that they saw XML as a transmission format for communications
            (hence the requirement that it be usable over the Internet).  They believed that XML's
            success was contingent upon it being flexible enough to "support a wide variety of
            applications."  They also clearly believed that for XML to succeed it must be easy
            to use, but they also recognized that the meaning of 'ease of use' is contingent upon
            the use one might make of the technology.  Ease of use for a document author ("XML
            documents shall be easy to create," "XML documents should be human-legible and reasonably
            clear") is a good deal different from ease of use for a software developer ("It shall
            be easy to write programs which process XML Documents," "The design of XML shall be
            formal and concise").
         </div>
         <div class="para e107">This relatively small set of goals for the XML language was further elaborated upon
            by members of the original W3C XML Working Group in a variety of papers they authored
            to introduce and clarify XML to its potential user community.  (
            <div class="xref e108" linkend="mcdo13"></div>) further defines the goals of XML as supporting the user needs of "extensibility,
            to define new tags as needed," "structure, to model data to any level of complexity,"
            "validation, to check data for structural correctness," "media independence, to publish
            content in multiple formats," and "vendor and platform independence, to process any
            conforming document using standard commercial software or even simple text tools."
            The benefits adhering to XML's providing a standardized format include "complete interoperability
            of both content and style across applications and platforms; freedom of content creators
            from vendor control of production tools; freedom of users to choose their own views
            into content; easy construction of powerful tools for manipulating content on a large
            scale; a level playing field for independent software developers; and true international
            publishing across all media."  Emancipatory language is invoked repeatedly here through
            the use of the terms 'freedom' and 'independence,' particularly  affording users the
            freedom "to define new tags" and in so doing "choose their own views into content."
            A key benefit to XML in this world view is the freedom it provides users to define
            their own structure for documents and data, using their own semantics, and to escape
            restrictions that software vendors (through their own inscriptions in their own products)
            might wish to impose on their users.  Other articles by members of the XML Working
            Group (see, for example, 
            <div class="xref e109" linkend="mcdo14"></div> and 
            <div class="xref e110" linkend="mcdo15"></div>) reiterate a vision of XML as a technology allowing users to define their own structures
            while simultaneously supporting interoperability of documents and data on a global
            scale.
         </div>
         <div class="para e111">The XML 1.0 Recommendation can be seen as bearing the inscription of its designers'
            ideological stance towards appropriate mechanisms for data and document structuring
            as well as appropriate relationships between document creators and software and platform
            vendors.  The effort to promote a meta-language over any specific markup language,
            the adoption of Unicode as a basic character set, and the elimination of SGML features
            such as CONCUR, OMITTAG and SUBDOC are some of the technological means through which
            XML's designers sought to normalize and reify a particular set of social and technological
            relationships.  Nor did this process stop with the release of the XML 1.0 recommendation
            in 1998.  The period between February 1998 and October 2001 saw the development and
            release of a plethora of additional XML specifications, including XML Namespaces,
            XSLT, XPath, XML Schema, XLink/XBase, XML Information Set and XSL-FO, as well as a
            variety of XML software tools including parsers, editors and stylesheet engines. 
            All of these various technological objects presented their own opportunities for their
            designers to further refine the ideological inscription carried within the XML 1.0
            Recommendation.  One of these objects in particular, the Namespaces in XML Recommendation,
            deserves further examination due to its significant impact on structural metadata
            standards developed by the digital library community.

                        modularity; if such a markup vocabulary exists which is well understood and for which
                        there is useful software available, it is better to re-use this markup rather than

            A strong motivating force for the

            of markup languages.  Interoperability was also cited by the World Wide Web Consortium

            <div class="xref e119" linkend="mcdo17"></div>).  Fundamentally, the authors of the 
            <div class="emphasis e120" role="ital">Namespaces in XML</div> recommendation wanted to simplify XML document authors' lives by insuring that they
            did not need to reinvent markup languages which already existed, and that they could
            readily mix elements and attributes conforming to disparate schemas within a single
            document instance without worrying about collisions between element and attribute
            names.

            on RDF (see 
            <div class="xref e137" linkend="mcdo19"></div>), the release of the XML Namespace and Schema recommendations seemed to provide the
            exact combination of flexibility, modularity, extensibility and interoperability that
            the digital library community needed for such a framework.

         <div class="para e140">In the same year that the XML 1.0 Recommendation was released, a research project
            undertaken by U.C. Berkeley Library, Cornell University Library, New York Public Library,
            Penn State University Library and Stanford University Library sought "to develop best
            practices for the encoding of intellectual, structural and administrative data about
            primary resources housed in research libraries" (
            <div class="xref e141" linkend="mcdo20"></div>). The project, known as the Making of America II (MOA2), sought to test its notions
            of "best practices" by developing a test bed repository of digital library materials
            that would be created by the participating institutions; the content and metadata
            for these digital library objects were to be transmitted to the central repository,
            housed at the U.C. Berkeley Library, using a transmission format to be developed by
            the project.
         </div>
         <div class="para e142">Given the participants' prior experience using SGML standards such as TEI and EAD,
            and the recent release of the XML 1.0 Recommendation, it was decided that the transmission
            format should be developed using XML.  This format, known as the MOA2 DTD

            </div>, was intended to convey descriptive metadata and administrative metadata about a
            digital library object, as well as providing a structural metadata framework which
            allowed MOA2 document authors to describe the logical or physical structure of a work
            (e.g., 'this is a book with chapters' or 'this is a bound volume with pages'), to
            associate portions of that structure with digital files representing the content of
            each portion, and to associate descriptive and administrative metadata with either
            segments of the work, or with the digital content files themselves.  As the transmission
            format needed to support a variety of work genres (including still photographs, journals,
            ledgers and diaries), the elements for describing the structure of the object were
            highly abstract.  Drawing upon previous work done by the Text Encoding Initiative,
            the MOA2 DTD represented the structure of any digital library object as a series of
            nested &lt;div&gt; elements.  Child &lt;fptr&gt; elements underneath a &lt;div&gt; associated the &lt;div&gt;
            with digital content files, and a variety of XML ID/IDREF attributes were used to
            link &lt;div&gt; elements and content files with descriptive and administrative metadata.
         </div>
         <div class="para e146">While the MOA2 DTD was reasonably successful, experiments with the use of the format
            outside the original research project revealed several deficiencies, including a lack
            of support for time-based media, and what was seen by members of the digital library
            community as an excessively restrictive model with respect to the descriptive and
            administrative metadata allowed within a MOA2 document.  In this latter regard, the
            MOA2 DTD was viewed as not living up to the promise of modular design and flexibility
            that should be upheld in XML schema design.  A successor effort, METS, was launched
            in 2001 to try to improve on the MOA2 DTD.  The METS format retained a very similar
            model for structuring a digital library object (with a few extensions to support time
            based media), but implemented a far more permissive structure with respect to descriptive
            and administrative metadata and was created using an XML Schema, rather than a DTD,
            in order to exploit XML namespaces and their further promise of modularity and schema
            reuse. The general structure for an object such as a digitized book in METS might
            look like this:

               &lt;/structMap&gt;
               &lt;/mets&gt;
               
            </div>
            The goal of representing the structure of a work as a hierarchy of nested &lt;div&gt; elements
            with TYPE attributes was to have a relatively simple, abstract hierarchical structure
            that could be readily applied to a variety of materials.  This was intended to promote
            the adoption of the standard (a single, simple standard is more likely to be adopted
            than a variety of complex ones), which in turn was seen as promoting interoperability.
            Having all of the digital library community using a single standard for structuring
            content and metadata would certainly be preferable to the community adopting a variety
            of disparate standards.
         </div>
         <div class="para e148">It should be noted that this move towards abstraction was a relatively significant
            break from the SGML design practices that many research libraries had been using to
            date.  While it is true that the notion of using nested &lt;div&gt; elements was derived
            from the TEI text apparatus, TEI does not rely on pure abstraction; one does not expect
            to encounter encoding such as &lt;div type="figure"&gt; in a TEI document, when a &lt;figure&gt;
            element is available to use.  Just as XML itself, the METS schema carries an inscription
            of its designers' worldview, that it was preferable to develop a single, simple, generalizable,
            highly abstract model and encoding mechanisms to structure content and metadata for
            digital library objects, rather than to pursue the development of a variety of highly
            specific schemas (one for photographs, one for journals, etc.), or a grand encompassing
            schema that contained elements appropriate to different genres that could be combined
            as needed (e.g., the TEI model).  Despite its use of the abstract &lt;div&gt; element with
            a TYPE attribute to represent the structural components of a digital library object,
            however, the METS schema insisted on the use of more specific concrete elements to
            identify different forms of metadata, with the &lt;dmdSec&gt; element used for descriptive
            metadata and the &lt;amdSec&gt; element used for administrative metadata, along with a series
            of subelements for different forms of administrative metadata (technical, rights,
            provenance and source).  This typification of different forms of metadata was itself
            an effort to promote modularity in further metadata schema development.  By identifying
            specific subclasses of metadata within the METS schema, METS' designers hoped to encourage
            XML developers in the digital library world to create discrete, specialized metadata
            standards that would align with those subclasses, and that those encoding digital
            library objects could then select from a set of such modular XML metadata standards
            in composing a particular object.  Through METS' design, its implementers consciously
            sought to encourage the adoption of modular schema design practices within the digital
            library community.
         </div>
         <div class="para e149">The digital library community was obviously not the only community in the late 1990s
            that recognized the potential benefits of XML, nor was it the only community to develop
            standards for structural metadata based on this notion of a highly abstract structure.
            In October of 2000, the Moving Picture Experts Group (MPEG) issued a call for proposals
            for "digital item declaration."  This work culminated in the release of the MPEG-21
            Digital Item Declaration (ISO/IEC 21000-2) standard in 2003.  While MPEG-21 is similar
            to the METS standard in employing a rather abstract hierarchical structural mechanism
            for ordering content and metadata, it differs inasmuch as non-structural metadata
            (&lt;Descriptor&gt; elements in MPEG-21 parlance) are not typed, and structural metadata
            elements, while still rather abstract, are of three different types: &lt;Container&gt;,
            &lt;Item&gt; and &lt;Component&gt;.  Our METS example above, if translated into MPEG-21 DIDL format,
            might take the following format:
            
            <div class="programlisting e150" xml:space="preserve">

               ref="urn:x-mets:Location_of_Page_One_TIFF_Image"&gt;
               &lt;/Resource&gt;
               &lt;/Component&gt;
               &lt;Component&gt;

               &lt;/Item&gt;
               &lt;/Item&gt;
               &lt;/Container&gt;
               &lt;/DIDL&gt;
               
            </div>
            While it obviously uses somewhat different element names and linking mechanisms than
            METS, MPEG-21 DIDL follows a very similar model, and has been successfully employed
            by several digital libraries.  The logical structure of the object is laid out via
            a hierarchical arrangement of &lt;Container&gt;, &lt;Item&gt; and &lt;Component&gt; elements, and various
            nodes in that tree structure can be associated with metadata via &lt;Descriptor&gt; elements,
            and content via &lt;Resource&gt; elements.
         </div>
         <div class="para e151">If we examine the MPEG-21 standard to determine what inscriptions its designers have
            placed within it regarding its use, we find messages very similar to that of METS.
            Structural metadata should be highly abstract, so that a very small set of elements
            can be employed to structure widely disparate content genres.  While METS was perhaps
            more vocal in trying to push the message that further development of metadata schemas
            should try to create small, focused and modular metadata sets that could be drawn
            upon as needed to encode a particular object, MPEG-21's use of &lt;Descriptor&gt; elements
            that can be associated with other elements throughout an MPEG-21 document conveys
            the same message.  Other structural metadata standards of interest to the digital
            library community employ similar mechanisms.  The XFDU standard for data archiving
            uses hierarchies of &lt;ContentUnit&gt; elements that may be associated with &lt;dataObjects&gt;
            and &lt;metadataObjects&gt;.  The IMS Content Packaging standard for learning objects uses
            hierarchies of &lt;item&gt; elements that may be associated with &lt;resources&gt; and &lt;metadata&gt;.
            While implementations differ in details, the pattern is similar and widespread across
            the various structural metadata standards of concern to the digital library community.
            Again and again we designers seeking to achieve wide adoption of their standard in
            order to promote interoperability between differing institutions; to secure this goal,
            they favor a highly abstract structural mechanism which can be applied to a wide variety
            of content, and mechanisms to allow a variety of additional metadata schema to 'plug
            and play' within the larger structural framework.
         </div>
         <div class="para e152">While of perhaps some limited interest to social researchers of technology, none of
            the preceding seems particularly surprising or problematic.  That the designers of
            XML itself, and of encoding standards for digital library metadata and content, should
            favor flexibility, extensibility, modularity and the use of abstraction to support
            the generalizability of their standard, and hence promote its widespread adoption
            to help achieve interoperability, would not be a great shock to anyone who has spent
            more than five minutes in the company of technologists.  These are all considered
            almost innate goods among software engineers in general and markup language enthusiasts
            in particular.  Yet the NDIIPP tests cited previously would seem to indicate that
            flexibility, extensibility, modularity and abstraction are not in and of themselves
            sufficient to achieve interoperability.  So what, specifically, is the problem that
            METS and other structural metadata standards are encountering?

         <div class="para e155">One of the earliest discussion points in the development of the METS standard was
            which of the various elements within the schema should be declared mandatory and which
            optional.  After some discussion among the members of the working group that established
            METS' original design, it was decided that the &lt;structMap&gt; element, which records
            the basic tree structure on to which content files and metadata are mapped in METS,
            would be the only required element.  METS, in the group's opinion, was fundamentally
            a 
            <div class="emphasis e156" role="ital">structural</div> metadata standard; it existed to provide a framework into which other descriptive
            and administrative metadata, as well as content, could be placed.  The &lt;structMap&gt;
            element provided the tree upon which all of the other structural components of METS
            where hung, where the logical and physical structure of a work could be delineated,
            and so was really the core of a METS file and the only section that needed to be mandatory.
            As the &lt;structMap&gt; was the only mandatory portion of a METS file, it was also expected
            that any structural description of a work should reside there; software that would
            process a METS file would expect to find logical or physical descriptions of the structure
            of a work residing within a structural map, and not elsewhere in the METS file.
         </div>
         <div class="para e157">It was a matter of some surprise for many in the METS community, then, when the Library
            of Congress, which serves as the maintenance agency for the METS standard, began to
            produce METS files for digital versions of certain kinds of audio recordings which
            placed the logical structure of the works in MODS records contained within the METS
            descriptive metadata section (&lt;dmdSec&gt;) rather than in the structural map, and registered
            a profile of METS establishing this as their formal internal practice for 'recorded
            events' (
            <div class="xref e158" linkend="mcdo21"></div>).  The MODS record within a METS file would provide a logical structure for the work
            using a hierarchical arrangement of the MODS &lt;relatedItem&gt; element, while the METS
            &lt;structMap&gt; would contain the physical structure, with ID/IDREF links used to draw
            connections between the two structural descriptions.  A recorded concert, for example,
            might have a MODS record containing a hierarchy such as this

         <div class="para e164">This represents a 
            <div class="emphasis e165" role="ital">valid</div> use of METS (in the technical XML sense), but is a departure from expected practice,
            which would be to include two structural maps within the METS file, one representing
            the physical structure and the second representing the logical structure of the work.
         </div>
         <div class="para e166">This example demonstrates two problems that have been impeding the development of
            interoperable content within the digital library community.  The first is that the
            implementation of highly abstract elements for the definition of structure provides
            a tremendous amount of flexibility to document encoders; there is a vast number of
            potential encodings of any given object in METS, with variations possible in depth
            of structure (do I limit my structure to musical movements or do I provide structural
            information to the measure level?), labeling (you say TYPE="book", I say TYPE="monograph"),
            and arrangement (should the Lord of Rings film trilogy be encoded as a single METS
            file?  Three METS files?  Three METS files for the individual films and a fourth representing
            the abstract notion of the Trilogy?).  This can lead to significant variation in encoding
            practices, even between two institutions dealing with remarkably similar material
            and using the same metadata standards, as noted by (
            <div class="xref e167" linkend="mcdo03"></div>).
         </div>
         <div class="para e168">The second problem is what we might call the problem of standards independence.  The
            various metadata schema standards which have been developed with the help of the digital
            library community during the past decade have all been created with the understanding
            that in order to ensure their usefulness in a variety of different organizations and
            environments, they should not contain inherent dependencies on other schemas; they
            need to be able to express all of the information necessary for their particular domain
            on their own.  For many of these standards, the designers recognized a need to be
            able to account for relationships between various content objects being described
            by the standard, whether the description being applied was the more traditional form
            of intellectual description you would expect in a library catalog, or a technical
            description of the composition of a TIFF image.  The result has been that a number
            of common metadata schemas within the digital library field contain elements for expressing
            structural metadata: Dublin Core has its &lt;relation&gt; element, MODS has its &lt;RelatedItem&gt;
            element, the PREMIS schema for preservation metadata has a &lt;relation&gt; element, even
            the MIX standard for still image technical metadata contains an element for referencing
            previous image metadata.  As the standards' developers felt they should not make their
            efforts dependent on structural metadata mechanisms in other standards, they implemented
            their own.  Unfortunately, with the addition of each new metadata standard containing
            structural metadata capabilities, the potential for difficulties with our first problem
            increases.  Every new metadata standard within the digital library community seems
            to add another mechanism for describing the structural relationships between content
            objects, and hence greater potential for variation in object encoding practices.
         </div>
         <div class="para e169">The irony is that both these problems derive from the flexibility, extensibility,
            modularity and use of abstraction to create structural metadata elements of wide applicability
            that the designers of the metadata schemas hoped to promote.  The potential range
            of variation in encoding structural metadata is the result of each of these factors.
            The use of abstraction in METS (i.e., the &lt;div&gt; element) was an attempt to make the
            standard flexible in application; however, it opens up a tremendous degree of play
            in encoding practice.  If you ask two different individuals how many page breaks there
            are in a text, the likelihood that they will get the same answer is a good deal greater
            than if you ask them how many divisions there are in a text.  The use of abstraction
            opens up encoding to a much greater degree of personal interpretation, and hence variation.
            The extensibility of METS and the hope to promote a modular system of metadata schema
            reuse that its authors inscribed within it open up the possibility of using other
            metadata schemas to encode structural metadata.  And it was this same desire for flexibility
            and modularity that has led other metadata schema designers to include structural
            metadata components in their own schema; they wanted to ensure that their own efforts
            were flexible enough to be applied in a variety of settings, and with a variety of
            other schemas.  But having to design their own schema without knowing the specific
            supporting capabilities to be found in other schemas with which their own might be
            used, they are inevitably forced to create structural metadata capacities of their
            own within their schema.  The designers of metadata schemas (structural or otherwise)
            within the digital library community have sought to adhere to a particular set of
            design practices, seeking to create flexible, extensible, modular and generalized
            tools, and to promote like practice in others through inscription of their view of
            appropriate XML design within their technological artifacts.  Unfortunately, promoting
            such good practices has been a death blow to one of the principle reasons for adopting
            XML in the first place: to ensure interoperability of digital library materials across
            systems.  wide-scale interoperability requires wide-scale adoption, but the design
            practices of schema implementers intended to promote wide-scale adoption run directly
            counter to wide spread interoperability.
         </div>
         <div class="para e170">Hence XML's similarity to a rope.  Like a rope, it is extraordinarily flexible; unfortunately,
            just as with rope, that flexibility makes it all too easy to hang yourself.

         <div class="title e172">Where do we go from here?</div>
         <div class="para e173">The digital library community seems to face a dilemma at this point.  Through its
            pursuit of design goals of flexibility, extensibility, modularity and abstraction,
            and its promulgation of those goals as common practice through its implementation
            of XML metadata standards, it has managed to substantially impede progress towards
            another commonly held goal, interoperability of digital library content across a range
            of systems.  How then, should the community respond?
         </div>
         <div class="para e174">One possible response to this situation would be to say that perhaps our community
            cares less about interoperability than we thought.  Despite the existence of projects
            such as the DLF Aquifer venture, it may be that interoperability is in fact a lower
            priority for the digital library community than it likes to believe, and the adoption
            of metadata standards that impede interoperability is merely a reflection of that
            underlying reality, and not a major problem to resolve.  There is at least some reason
            to suspect this may be the case.  Most research libraries have a clearly defined local
            clientele, and while voices within the digital library community have been calling
            for the liberation of content from local silos for some time (
            <div class="xref e175" linkend="mcdo22"></div>), libraries' primary responsibility will always be to their local communities.  If
            systems developed to deliver digital library content to the local community are successful
            in that context, and if the costs associated with achieving much more widespread interoperability
            are high, then many libraries may decide that interoperability, while desirable, is
            a goal which may have to wait.
         </div>
         <div class="para e176">If libraries do wish to make progress on the issue of interoperability of structural
            metadata, they will need to recognize that, as (
            <div class="xref e177" linkend="mcdo23"></div>) observed, "every significant information processing standardization effort must
            skillfully negotiate competing and apparently irreconcilable objectives, [and] serve
            a wide variety of stakeholders with many different interests."  In the case of structural
            metadata, the particular competing objectives that the digital library community does
            not seem to have successfully reconciled to date are what (
            <div class="xref e178" linkend="mcdo24"></div>), in a discussion of blogging practices, has labeled the problem of "control vs.
            connection."  The structural metadata standards which have been developed to date,
            with their emphasis on flexibility, extensibility and modularity have sought to afford
            local institutions the greatest degree of control possible in their encoding practices.
            The standards are designed to allow any given institution to do what it wants.  This
            has obvious benefits in terms of easing adoption of the standard in any given context,
            and as a result insuring the standards' widespread adoption (obviously a good thing
            in a standard).  However, increasing the amount of local control over the ways in
            which a language is used and developed is fundamentally at odds with a language's
            ability to serve as a means for connection with others outside the local context.
            It is, in essence, promoting the development of regional dialects at the expense of
            mutual intelligibility.  The particular case of structural metadata standards reveals
            that sufficient local variation in syntax, the ways in which people structure their
            objects using a markup language, can be as fatal to communication as variation in
            semantics.
         </div>
         <div class="para e179">Given this fundamental tradeoff between control and connection, libraries wishing
            to promote interoperability of digital library content have two possible strategies.
            The first, and most obvious, is to attempt to alter the balance currently struck between
            connection and control to more strongly favor connection.  There are several mechanisms
            which the library community might employ in pursuit of this strategy, including the
            design and use of schema which more significantly restrict both the means for recording
            the structure of objects and the ability to employ arbitrary additional schema within
            instance documents (or developing profiles of existing schema to achieve the same
            ends),  establishing formal rules of structural description (equivalent to rules of
            description used in cataloging for creating bibliographic records) dictating aspects
            of object encoding not susceptible to enforcement through XML's validation mechanisms,
            and mandating the use of particular controlled vocabularies and ontologies within
            document instances to record information such as a &lt;div&gt; element's TYPE attribute
            in METS.  Decreasing the possibility for local variation in encoding of structural
            metadata will certainly help improve digital libraries' capability to interoperate
            with each other.  However, removing local capacity for variation will also tend to
            reduce the number of institutions who are willing to use such a markup language. 
            If the digital library community, for instance, was to revise the METS standard to
            forbid any use of a &lt;relation&gt; or &lt;RelatedItem&gt; element in a descriptive metadata
            section to express the logical structure of a work, it would assist in insuring interoperability
            of digital content, but it might also very well mean losing the Library of Congress's
            support for the standard.  More importantly, however, such an approach seems to overlook
            one of the fundamental realities of the web environment: communities of practice no
            longer operate in splendid isolation from each other (if indeed, they ever did). 
            Even if libraries could agree on a structural metadata standard that enabled a significantly
            greater degree of support for interoperability than we find with today's standards,
            libraries must now interact with a variety of other communities (publishers, museums,
            archives, educational technology companies, etc.) that are also creating their own
            structural metadata standards.  The odds of our moving past this structural tower
            of Babel to achieve a single object encoding practice across all communities do not
            look promising, to say the least.
         </div>
         <div class="para e180">The second, and I believe more promising, strategy is to accept that the need for
            local community control over encoding practices is a valid one, that regional 'dialects'
            of markup languages are inevitable, and that we must find ways to facilitate information
            exchange across the boundaries of different communities' markup vernacular.  However,
            this will require a significant shift in the digital library community's relationship
            to the notion of standards.  Specifically, I believe the library community needs to
            shift from its current singular focus on schema development to a dual focus on both
            schema development 
            <div class="emphasis e181">and</div> translation between schemas.  It is worth noting here that the Library of Congress
            currently serves as maintenance agency for a variety of XML standards developed within
            the library community; if you examine the list of standards that they are maintaining
            (
            <div class="xref e182" linkend="mcdo26"></div>), however, you will find that while there are several metadata standards listed,
            standardized stylesheets to enable conversion between formats are not listed here.

         <div class="para e183">Such stylesheets do exist in some cases.  The Library of Congress has, for example,
            provided stylesheets to enable conversion of MODS descriptive metadata records into
            MARC/XML format and back.  These efforts to formalize prior work that established
            cross-walks between different descriptive metadata standards are not, however, seen
            by the community as having the status and importance of standards, as exhibited by
            their omission from the 'Standards at the Library of Congress' web page.  If the digital
            library community wishes to support interoperability while simultaneously affording
            institutions localized control over encoding practices, that situation needs to change.
            Enabling translation activity must be seen as important, if not more important, a
            standards activity than the creation of schema for metadata sets.
         </div>
         <div class="para e184">A heightened emphasis on standardizing translation between markup languages will obviously
            mean further work on formalizing translations between markup languages using XSLT,
            and treating those with the level of attention and care that the community has lavished
            on metadata schema.  However, it might also be worth considering whether the notion
            of formal rules of structural description mentioned earlier might be of benefit in
            trying to achieve greater translatability between different markup languages.  As
            an example of what this might mean, consider the example of the 1:1 principle in Dublin
            Core (
            <div class="xref e185" linkend="mcdo25"></div>), that a single Dublin Core record should describe one and only one resource.  The
            1:1 principle provides guidance on the relationship between a metadata record and
            a described resource that is applicable outside the realm of Dublin Core; in fact,
            several other descriptive metadata standards developed since Dublin Core have made
            reference to the 1:1 principle as a guide to usage.  We could easily envisage similar
            principles being developed for structural metadata that could guide usage of a variety
            of different structural metadata standards, and by working to insure similar use practices,
            would help insure ease of translation between different structural markup languages.
            We might, for instance, take as a working principle that any given structural metadata
            document should never contain more than two levels of structural hierarchy.  Our METS
            example above passes muster with this rule; if, however, we modified it so that a
            third level of &lt;div&gt; elements was needed (of TYPE 'subchapter', for example), then
            we would be in violation of this principle.  To fix this problem, we could employ
            METS' &lt;mptr&gt; element to allow the &lt;div&gt; elements for each chapter to reference separate
            METS files containing the structural descriptions for the individual chapters.  Through
            the establishment of common principles of structural encoding and standardized stylesheets
            for translation, we might be able to improve our ability to interoperate while simultaneously
            retaining some flexibility for local encoding practice (although obviously adoption
            of common principles of structural encoding may impede local control in favor of connection
            to some degree).
         </div>
         <div class="para e186">The rise of the network information society is presenting libraries with a variety
            of new challenges.  Perhaps the most significant of these is the heightened degree
            of interaction with communities of practice that do not share libraries' standards,
            practices or values.  If libraries are to survive and thrive in this new information
            society, they must alter their own value structure to prioritize communication with
            other communities to an equal, if not greater, extent than internal communication
            between libraries.  If they pursue this course, they may find that issues of internal
            interoperability of library systems are more tractable than they have appeared to
            date.
