            <div class="para e7">XML has been designed for creating structured documents, but the information that
               is
               encoded in these structures are, by definition, out of scope for XML.
               Additional sources, normally not easily interpretable by computers,
               such as documentation are needed to determine the intention of specific tags in a
               tag-set. The Component
               Metadata Infrastructure (CMDI) takes a rather pragmatic approach to foster interoperability
               between XML instances
               in the domain of metadata descriptions for language resources. This paper gives an
               overview of this approach.

         <div class="para e72"> XML documents are commonly used to exchange data. The strict definition of the
            Markup-Language resulted in a variety of tools and every XML instance (given it is
            well-formed) can be processed by of-the-shelf tools. XML has been designed for
            creating structured documents, but the information that is encoded in these structures
            are, by definition, out of scope for XML.
            Therefore, generic identifier like 
            <div class="code e73">p</div> can have different meanings, depending
            on which concrete markup language (or here: XML tag-set) is used. For example, in
            the case of
            HTML it denotes a paragraph while it may denote something completely different in
            another
            tag-set. An XML schema language, e.g. like DTD, XML Schema or RelaxNG, define a
            grammar for a given markup language and thus valid XML instances can be told apart
            from
            invalid ones, but they do not provide any inherent semantics to “understand” the XML
            instances. The necessary knowledge to interpret a markup language usually exists in
            the form
            of human-readable documentation and is “out of reach” for the computer. However, when
            trying
            to exchange (more or less) arbitrary XML instance some form of knowledge is needed
            to
            interpret these documents. The topic of the semantics of markup has been mostly discussed
            from
            an academic point of view, see e.g. 
            <div class="xref e74" linkend="sperberg-mcqueen2011"></div>. 
         </div>
         <div class="para e75"> The Component Metadata Infrastructure (CMDI) takes a rather pragmatic approach towards
            adding some semantics to XML to allow exchange of metadata descriptions encoded in
            various
            metadata formats in a (slightly adapted) XML encoding. This is done by linking generic
            identifiers to semantic concepts in a data category registry and thus allow more profound
            interpretation of the markup. The CMDI approach is set in the domain of metadata descriptions,
            but may be generalized to be used within other domains.

         <div class="para e80"> The Component Metadata Infrastructure is developed in the context of the CLARIN project
            (
            <div class="xref e81" linkend="varadi2008"></div>). CLARIN aims at building an integrated and interoperable
            research infrastructure for language resources. The goal is to provide a stable, persistent
            and accessible infrastructure for the eHumanities. One important aspect of CLARIN
            is to enable
            easy sharing of language resources. This will allow researchers to use existing resources
            as a
            basis for their work, e.g. by optimizing their existing or new tools, by building
            derivative
            resources or expose their resources to a broader audience. Therefore, to make this
            infrastructure more usable, resources need to be easily accessible, in particular
            easily
            findable. The most common approach towards achieving this is to provide descriptive
            metadata
            about these resources and use these information to find resources of interest for
            a particular
            researcher. 
         </div>
         <div class="para e82">Part of this context is also an already large installed base of metadata descriptions
            available using fixed metadata schemas as 
            <div class="xref e83" linkend="IMDI3013"></div> and 
            <div class="xref e84" linkend="OLAC"></div>.
            Although the quality of the metadata is sometimes questionable, it would be unacceptable
            to put
            a new framework into place that would lock out these existing metadata resources
         </div>
         <div class="para e85"> Since CLARIN is a rather large, diverse project, different project members have different
            opinions on how to adequately model the metadata for their types of resources. For
            a lot of
            existing resources extensive amounts of metadata descriptions are already available.
            It seems
            naïve to assume that agreement on a common metadata schema for a large-scale project
            like
            CLARIN can be achieved and will most likely result in the least common denominator,
            e.g. Dublin
            Core (
            <div class="xref e86" linkend="DC"></div>, 
            <div class="xref e87" linkend="baker1998"></div>), losing a lot of the express power that is used in
            existing metadata, as would using a “pivot” schema, both would result in information
            loss.
            
            CLARIN tries to solve the problem by the Component Metadata Infrastructure (CMDI),
            which is
            basically a framework to accommodate for different XML-based metadata formats. CMDI
            provides,
            supported by various tools, a framework and work flows for creating metadata formats
            and
            metadata descriptions as well as semantic foundation for processing metadata descriptions.

            <div class="para e90"> CMDI is a framework (see 
               <div class="xref e91" linkend="fig-cmdi-framework"></div>) to build component based
               metadata descriptions. A metadata component is basically a collection of atomic metadata
               fields or data categories (DatCats) and describes a specific aspect or dimension of
               a
               resource, e.g. the title of a document, the creator or the native language of a subject
               in a
               video recording. Components can have a recursive structure, i.e. in addition to atomic
               fields, the components can also contain other components. Thus, components serve as
               small
               building blocks or reusable templates for a specific aspect of a resource. Together
               with a
               header, these components are combined into metadata profiles, each of which can be
               used as a
               schema for metadata instances. Both, components and profiles can (and should) be stored
               in a
               component registry, which is a directory of components to be reused in different contexts.
               Users can either reuse existing profiles for their metadata descriptions or create
               new
               profiles by reusing or creating new components, either manually or with a specialized
               component editor. Various profiles already exists in the component registry, e.g.
               for IMDI,
               OLAC, Dublin Core or the TEI header.

               The storage of the schemas in a centralized infrastructure is common practice for
               metadata schemas, 
               though of course this adds the problem of sustainability to the process, inasmuch
               as the repository 
               of schemas needs to be constantly available. 
               Though this could be seen as problematic in principle for pragmatic reasons it seems
               more appropriate 
               than to use local copies with modifications, because it makes sure that tools can
               operate on the centrally 
               stored files. For a metadata archive, a local store of schema copies could be instantiated,
               but this would 
               result in the requirement to adjust the schema reference, for interoperability this
               could cause an additional 
               problem. Hence the use of a central infrastructure is probably the safest solution
               and in the context of an 
               infrastructure of data and services most likely to be sustainable. This is also consistent

               Each metadata field is linked to exactly one data category in a data category registry
               (DCR)
               using a persistent identifier. The DCR indicates how the content of the field in a
               metadata
               description should be interpreted. If the same data category is used in various metadata
               schemas, the reference to the DCR will still be the same. This is also independent
               of the
               concrete naming of the XML element, including names, cases and orthographic variants.
               
               For example, the field 
               <div class="code e97">title</div> in 
               <div class="code e98">titleStmt</div> in the TEI header is linked
               to the same category as the 
               <div class="code e99">title</div> in Dublin Core.

               implementation of the ISO 12620 standard model for data categories and offers ample
               functionality for the needs of the CMDI framework. For the CMDI framework it makes
               no
               essential difference if another registry such as for instance the
               
               <div class="xref e102" linkend="DCMI"></div> is used. However the ISO-DCR does have a tight integration with other CMDI software
               components such as the component editor, for efficient searching for suitable data
               categories
               or even combining metadata modelling with defining new data categories. 
            </div>
            <div class="para e103"> The component registry contains CMDI components and profiles. If a metadata creator
               needs to describe a (for him) new type of resource, he can browse through the available

               available he can create a new one, based on existing components or he can create new

               to enter the data. Of course users may also use an XML editor to create metadata descriptions

               doing

               of these
               semantic mapping using the ISO-DCR plays a crucial role. When a user specifies a metadata
               query, the ISO-DCR then allows to expand this query into set of equivalent ones that
               will be
               able to retrieve metadata records where a different terminology than specified in
               the

               terms
               and these are then used to generate an additional query. E.g. when a user queries

               <div class="code e109">titleStmt</div> an additional query is generated for

               Other representation formats such as RDF, OWL and Topic Maps do not seem appropriate
               for the description of the metadata in comparison to CMDI. It is obvious, 
               that CMDI due the recursive structure of defining components can become rather complex,
               but the structures are at least assumed to be human readable and structured 
               according to a human prose text on a resource. 
               In contrast to this, the RDF-family is not requiring the linear order, presenting
               the RDF-triples in arbitrary order. 
               Though CMDI documents can be rendered in RDF (and probably in OWL and Topic Maps),
               the struture of CMDI is more transparent and usable to human users. CMDI is also 
               not a form of knowledge representation, in which the concepts of a resource are described,
               but it is intended to provide structured information about a resource for

         <div class="title e172">Conclusion</div>
         <div class="para e173"> XML encoding is a solid foundation to encode metadata descriptions. In the past,
            various
            different metadata schemas emerged based on XML technology, like 
            <div class="xref e174" linkend="IMDI3013"></div>,
            
            <div class="xref e175" linkend="OLAC"></div> and 
            <div class="xref e176" linkend="DCMI"></div>.
            Several technologies, like OAI-PMH have been created for the easy dissemination of
            XML encoded
            metadata descriptions. However, XML is not sufficient to exchange data. One either
            has to
            agree on a common schema or transform their data into pivot formats. Especially with
            rich and
            elaborated metadata schemas these approaches are cumbersome and most often lead to
            loss of
            information. A level beyond XML is needed to convey semantic information about the
            markup,
            which allows to draw further conclusions on the information encoded in XML documents.
            The
            CLARIN project takes a rather pragmatic approach towards this problem by adding registries
            for
            metadata components and data categories. The information of both registries combined
            allow to
            perform, at least to some extend, reasoning about the information encoded in metadata
            descriptions. For example, more sophisticated searches are possible. To some extend,
            this
            approach can be generalized and applied to other scenarios to foster XML document
            interchange
            without nervelessly requiring to agree on a common XML markup schema. At the time
            of this
            writing, CMDI has been proposed as a work item in ISO/TC&nbsp;37/SC&nbsp;4.
