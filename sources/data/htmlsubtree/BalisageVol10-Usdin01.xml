         <div class="title e21">Welcome to 
            <div class="emphasis e22" role="ital">Balisage</div>
         </div>
         <div class="para e23">The first thing I have to say is “Welcome to 
            <div class="emphasis e24" role="ital">Balisage</div>, and welcome to Montréal.”  This is my favorite week of the year, and I want to be
            sure that you all enjoy it too.
         </div>
         <div class="para e25">Before I start talking about what’s really on my mind and what I said I was going
            to talk about, which is “semantics”, I want to talk about something that should go
            without saying, but two people caught me yesterday and asked me to say a few words
            about expected behavior this week — as I did last year and the year before and probably
            every year before that — it’s what I think of as the “Conference Mommy Moment”.  I’m
            talking about courtesy for everyone at this conference.  As far as I’m concerned,
            every one of you is my guest, and that means I expect every one of you to treat each
            other as my guests.  I don’t expect you to agree with each other, and in fact a large
            part of what we’re here to do is to disagree.  That’s a lot of the fun; we frequently
            disagree on how to address problems that we agree are important.  And we sometimes
            disagree on what is important and why.  I hope such disagreements are heartfelt, articulate,
            and clear.  I insist they be respectful.
         </div>
         <div class="para e26">This means challenging the idea, not the person.  By the way, “That’s the dumbest
            idea I have ever heard” is not challenging the idea.  That’s challenging the person
            whether the sentence seems to use the word “idea” as its subject or not.  “I think
            there are some important factors that you should consider that might change your mind,
            for example, …” is challenging the idea.
         </div>
         <div class="para e27">Another aspect of treating each other with courtesy is using the microphones.  Many
            of you are used to speaking to large groups.  Many of you believe you can be heard
            well without a microphone.  I am telling you that there are people in this room who
            will not be able to hear you or understand you if you don’t use a microphone.  If
            you have anything more to say than “Yea, verily, yea,” get up out of your seat and
            go stand at the microphone.  (Shouting “Yea, verily, yea” from your seat will do just
            fine.)
         </div>
         <div class="para e28">Eschewing the microphone means that people with less than perfect hearing may have
            trouble understanding you, and people with relatively little English — or with an
            English accent dramatically different than yours — will have a difficult time understanding
            you.  And it wouldn’t be a bad idea to eschew words such as “eschew” which many people
            don’t understand.
         </div>
         <div class="para e29">I like 
            <div class="emphasis e30" role="ital">Balisage</div> for a lot of reasons.  I like 
            <div class="emphasis e31" role="ital">Balisage</div> because I think of it as a playground where a group of really smart people gather
            together to learn from each other.  This means it is a gathering of friends, but it
            is also a gathering of  “might be” friends.  I suggest that those of you who know
            twenty or thirty people in this room consider the fact that there are probably twenty
            or thirty other people in this room who might become friends if you spent time talking
            with them.  It is easy for those of us who know and like each other and see each other
            once a year to concentrate on old friends.  I’m not saying you shouldn’t do that —
            I’m not saying you shouldn’t enjoy the people you know — but meet some of these other
            people because it’s a good bet they’re pretty smart.
         </div>
         <div class="para e32">“Tell them where to meet!”  First of all, there’s the riskiest thing to do — which
            I highly recommend:  sit down next to somebody you don’t know at lunch.  What’s the
            worst thing that’s going to happen?  They’re going to be boring.  Odds are, they won’t.
            Because they’re here.  And we don’t have a lot of boring people here.
         </div>
         <div class="para e33">However, we also have a conference office downstairs.  You can tell it’s the conference
            office because there’s a 
            <div class="emphasis e34" role="ital">Balisage</div> logo on the door.  And when that door is open, come on in!  We have chairs, we have
            tables.  We’ve also got a printer there, so stop in if you need to print a few pages.
            And we’ve got a refrigerator with some water in it.  So come by!  This evening go
            across the hall to dinner.  After that, if you’re looking for a group of people to
            go out with, check the office; in the early evening, people will gather there and
            make groups.  It’s a good place to be.
         </div>
         <div class="para e35">This is sort of a week-long party.  I don’t actually go to parties where people have
            projectors and  throw their slides up on the wall, but I do go to parties where people
            climb on metaphorical soaps boxes and make speeches about all sorts of things that
            they care a lot about, which is one of the things we’re going to do at 
            <div class="emphasis e36" role="ital">Balisage</div>.
         </div>
         <div class="para e37">I actually go to dinner parties where things get a little weirder than that.  I remember
            one group — I think there were eight of us — in a very, very fancy French restaurant
            in the Georgetown area of Washington where somebody pulled out a dataflow diagram
            and passed it around the table.  And the first person who got it, looked at it for
            a minute and snickered, then passed it to the next person who laughed.  It went all
            the way around the table, and everybody laughed.  After everybody had had a chance
            to look at the joke, we discussed where the error had to be and how silly this diagram
            was.  It said there was one office that was going to fill with paper documents because
            there were all these paper documents being printed, and they went to this one person,
            and they never left.  And then the guy who brought this diagram pulled a photograph
            of that office out of his pocket.  It was stacked to the ceiling with paper, with
            little paths through it.  We laughed at that, and it occurred to somebody that there
            we were sitting in a restaurant drinking wine … and passing around a dataflow diagram.
            Some of those people are here, and many of the rest of you would have enjoyed the
            evening.  It’s that kind of crowd.
         </div>
         <div class="para e38">I like 
            <div class="emphasis e39" role="ital">Balisage</div> because I learn a lot here.  I learn about interesting things people are doing with
            marked up content and interesting applications people are developing to create and
            manipulate and display marked up content.  But that isn’t surprising.  It is the markup
            conference, after all.
         </div>
         <div class="para e40">More interesting, I learn about the sorts of problems that people are paying attention
            to in the first place.  As I read the submissions to this conference, I read about
            people using markup to solve problems I hadn’t even realized were problems.  People
            are doing work I never thought anybody cared about, solving problems I had not thought
            about at all.  That’s really interesting.
         </div>
         <div class="para e41">Every year I leave here knowing that I know less than I thought I did when I arrived.
            I recommend that approach.  I suppose that’s the reason my house is filling with books,
            though now that I’m buying both print books and electronic books, I keep hoping that
            will mean the rate at which I acquire physical books is going to be reduced.
         </div>
         <div class="para e42">I leave 
            <div class="emphasis e43" role="ital">Balisage</div> with a long list of things I need to learn more about:  details of things I didn’t
            know about, aspects of specifications and tools I hadn’t known about, big things I
            need to know about, whole new specifications, capabilities, problems.  That’s a lot
            of what you’re going to pick here:  things to go learn about.
         </div>
         <div class="para e44">One of the things that I keep learning about is the limitations of my knowledge and
            the way that I reveal those in my use of language.  I, for example, cannot have an
            informed conversation with my nephew about Pokymon because I use the language incorrectly
            and it is clear that I don’t know what I’m talking about.  (I’m actually okay with
            not being able to have an informed conversation about Pokymon with a five-year-old.)
            But I’m not so okay about not being able to have what sounds like an informed conversation
            about some of the things that I think matter to me, for example, semantics.  (Hey,
            I finally got to what I said I was going to talk about.)

         <div class="title e46">The word “semantic”</div>
         <div class="para e47">I recently learned that I don’t know what the word “semantics” means.  This is interesting
            because I thought I did.  I thought I’ve known that for a long time.  Way back in
            pre-history — before I had ever heard of markup when the only use I knew for pointy
            brackets were mathematical expressions (some of us were not born knowing what chicken
            lips are good for, you know) — I thought I knew what semantics meant.  I thought semantics
            was the study of what words meant, and the study of semantics focused on how the meanings
            of words were created and changed and, occasionally, lost.  I had more than a casual
            interest in words and terms and their meanings; my first real job — after I escaped
            from the educational establishment — was as a lexicographer.  A lexicographer??  A
            person who creates dictionaries, or in my case, controlled vocabularies for search-and-retrieval
            systems.  Semantics was the heart of my work.  I thought I knew what semantics meant.
            We were very careful to create controlled vocabularies that had a minimum of homophones
            in them and a minimum of ambiguity — notice we never promised we would get rid of
            either — we were very careful with selecting our terms and defining them to control
            the semantics of the datasets that were going to be indexed with them.  So, a long
            time ago I knew what semantics meant.
         </div>
         <div class="para e48">And then I got involved with markup.  I got there because the way we were creating
            these full-text databases that we were indexing with the controlled vocabularies I
            was making is that people typeset and printed this material, and the first two copies
            to come from the printer were then sent immediately to be processed into the full-text
            system.  So we waited until we had bound books, then we cut off the bindings, and
            we sent them to two different rekeying shops to be retyped.  Those two files were
            compared, and then we built a searchable database from them.
         </div>
         <div class="para e49">This was problematic.  Among other things, people had already proofread it once to
            make the print, and they didn’t want to do it again, besides which it took a long
            time and was expensive.  The full-text databases might take up to a year or year and
            a half after the print was out.  This was imperfect.  Very imperfect.
         </div>
         <div class="para e50">So, we started getting involved in ways we could make both the print and the database
            from the same source, and we had these pointy-bracket things that we were putting
            around parts of the document.  We had documents where parts of them laid out in a
            grid shape.  And there were two different ways that we could identify the information
            we wanted to see in a grid.  We could identify them by what kind of information it
            was, for example, “condition, patient age, and dosage.”  Or we could identify it in
            rows and columns; how did you want it laid out in that grid shape?  You could do a
            lot more with the information if you identified it by what kind of information it
            was — “condition,” “patient age,” and “dosage” — than if you had “first column,” “second
            column,” “third column.”  But it was a lot harder to set things so you displayed it
            in the grid shape you wanted it in.  You only did that for stuff that you had a lot
            of and it was worth spending effort on.
         </div>
         <div class="para e51">I learned that when you identified the kind of information it was, we called that
            semantic tagging.  And when you identified what cell in the table you wanted it in,
            we called that syntactic tagging.
         </div>
         <div class="para e52">Okay, this was related to what I thought I knew.  Semantics means “what it means,”
            and syntax means “what you want it to look like.”  Okay, we can work with this.
         </div>
         <div class="para e53">And then I learned that the line between syntax and semantics is a squishy line; it
            slides around.  Somebody explained it to me:  “If you understand how to cope with
            it, it’s syntax.  And if you can’t quite manage it — there’s a little magic in the
            formula — it’s semantics.”  (Actually, I think there may be something to that.)
         </div>
         <div class="para e54">I have recently learned that semantically-rich content is the key to future wealth:
            precise searching, high quality retrieval, good health, great weather.  Or at least
            that’s what it seems like.  The “semantic web,” for example, is going to solve all
            of our economic, social, and perhaps even climate problems.  Some of the people promising
            these wonders berate me because I’ve advised clients to manage their content in ways
            that are not “future friendly,” specifically in ways that are not semantic.  Okay,
            what do we mean by that?
         </div>
         <div class="para e55">Well, I’ve advised them to identify names and given names and family names and to
            associate them with institutional and public identifiers; to identify institution
            names, street names, drug names; to identify if a drug name is a brand name, a generic
            name, or a street name.  I think identifying all that stuff in a document collection
            is creating a semantically-rich document collection, so why are these people so cross?
         </div>
         <div class="para e56">Because there’s no semantic tagging in those documents!  What??  Well, there isn’t
            a triple in sight.  Oh, I understand.  There is only one appropriate syntax for semantics
            now.  Whoops.
         </div>
         <div class="para e57">That’s just a little bit narrow-minded.  I wish it were really news; it actually isn’t.</div>
         <div class="para e58">A few years ago — actually, quite a few years ago, now that I think about it — someone
            asked for permission to include the proceedings of one of 
            <div class="emphasis e59" role="ital">Balisage</div>’s predecessor conferences in a topic map — Remember topic maps?  Topic maps were
            cool. — about things related to SGML (Does anybody remember SGML?)  So, after all
            the appropriate logistical details had been taken care of and the lawyers had all
            waived their hands and blessed this activity, I provided the necessary SGML files
            and instantly received back a howl of anger.  What could we have been thinking?? 
            This data was unusable.  How stupid could we possibly be?  Didn’t we know that the
            point of creating SGML was to make it repurposable?  (Actually, I had thought that
            the point of creating that particular SGML was to create the proceedings for that
            event, not to accommodate unknown future users and to work with products that had
            not yet been invented, but perhaps not.)
         </div>
         <div class="para e60">So, what was the problem that caused this outrage?  The keywords were hierarchically
            structured; this was already problematic.  Worse, the nesting was indicated with colons!
            This was outrageous.  It was unprofessional.  It was unacceptable.  It was slovenly.
            It meant that they would have to preprocess the data before they could pour it into
            their tool.
         </div>
         <div class="para e61">I smell a failure of imagination.</div>
         <div class="para e62">These sorts of disagreements on the meaning of semantic don’t actually end there,
            and they didn’t end many years ago when we were talking about inconceivably badly
            structured SGML files because they contained colons.  My colleague, Debbie Lapeyre,
            who is sitting over there, was the JATS expert in a group of people who recently wrote
            a paper entitled “From Markup to Linked Data: Mapping NISO JATS version 1.0 to RDF
            using the SPAR Ontologies.”

         <div class="para e66">Her co-authors were astonished that, in this day and age, a respectable and respected
            vocabulary such as JATS could be totally lacking in semantics.  Her co-authors were
            shocked to learn that in JATS, for example, the names and the definitions of the tags
            embedded in the document identified what the information meant; there wasn’t a separate
            ontology that identified what the tags meant.
         </div>
         <div class="para e67">Perhaps even more peculiar to them was the fact that structures nest and context affects
            meaning.  For example, the tag &lt;article-title&gt; in the header of the document contained
            the title of the article, and the tag &lt;article-title&gt; in a citation in the reference
            list contained the title of an article being referenced by this article. That was
            very peculiar to them.
         </div>
         <div class="para e68">That and a variety of other oddnesses convinced them that either Debbie was from another
            planet or there were no semantics in JATS.  They were very kind to her.  I think they
            treated her as if she were an idiot savant, knowing a lot about this peculiar XML
            stuff, but knowing nothing about semantics … or anything semantic.
         </div>
         <div class="para e69">To give them credit, they did include a section in the paper that I think properly
            should have been entitled “Peering Through the Looking Glass.”  They called it something
            like “Philosophical Differences between RDF and XML” — which in fact they didn’t really
            address — in which they described the difficulty of describing in RDF terms data that
            is based on such a different philosophical point of view.  I wish they were here at
            
            <div class="emphasis e70" role="ital">Balisage</div> because they were able to recognize that a completely alien viewpoint might not be
            stupid and might provide something of interest and importance to them.
         </div>
         <div class="para e71">We at this conference — each of us — are going to encounter a few completely alien
            viewpoints.  That’s one of the things the 
            <div class="emphasis e72" role="ital">Balisage</div> committee looks for as we select the papers.  When we get peer reviews back for 
            <div class="emphasis e73" role="ital">Balisage</div> papers, the papers we take instantly are the ones where some of the peer reviewers
            say “Yes, that’s brilliant!” and other peer reviewers say “No, that makes no sense.”
            We like those papers!!  We like the alien viewpoints.
         </div>
         <div class="para e74">To circle back:  it’s not that I don’t think ontologies are useful.  I think they
            can be.  In some circumstances, they are very valuable indeed.  And I’ll even acknowledge
            that it’s possible — although in my opinion it’s far from a sure thing — that widely
            shared ontologies will be of increasing value.  I’m suspicious because I used to write
            ontologies, and I know how good many of them aren’t.  I don’t think links to ontologies
            are the only way semantically rich information can and should be created or managed.
            I don’t think RDF triples are the only syntax in which semantic information can be
            created, managed, or stored.
         </div>
         <div class="para e75">I’m reminded of long passionate arguments at predecessor conferences to this one about
            what kind of information should be stored in elements and what kind of information
            should be stored in attributes.   People cared.  People got red in the face.  They
            banged on tables.
         </div>
         <div class="para e76">There were people who said all element content should be banned and all content should
            be stored as attribute values.  They were serious, and they thought it was important.
         </div>
         <div class="para e77">There were people who said attributes were nothing but syntactic sugar and should
            be banned from the language.  Everything should be element content; it would be much
            easier to process.  They were equally serious.
         </div>
         <div class="para e78">There were people who came up with complex formulations for what should be in which
            place.  My favorite one — which in some circumstances may be reasonable — was:  If
            the end user should see it, then it should be element content.  But if you use it
            to control the display or for other back room uses, it should be attribute content.
            That makes sense until you realize that you can’t actually decide for all time for
            any content what users will see and what they won’t because the line between data
            and metadata is really fuzzy and keeps moving.
         </div>
         <div class="para e79">But this mattered to them.  It mattered to them a lot.  And then XSLT came along,
            and it seemed to occur as a flash of insight to huge numbers of people simultaneously
            that it was actually a pretty trivial transformation to take something that was attribute
            content and make it element content, and take something that was element content and
            make it an attribute value if you really cared.  We can change the syntax if it isn’t
            what we want for our tool at this moment.
         </div>
         <div class="para e80">Suddenly, that argument became moot.  Fortunately, I haven’t heard it in a while.</div>
         <div class="para e81">I suggest that much, if not most, of the posturing about the appropriate syntax for
            semantic information is or should be similarly moot.  It’s just not important.  And
            if you disagree with me, I guess I can’t punch you in the nose — we’re at 
            <div class="emphasis e82" role="ital">Balisage</div>.  And I’m not going to call you a nasty name because we’re at 
            <div class="emphasis e83" role="ital">Balisage</div>.  So, I’m going to ask you to explain why you think it matters in a clear and coherent
            fashion.  And I will remind you that if you explain it in a clear and coherent and
            respectful fashion, I might even change my mind and agree with you.  And if your argument
            is “because that’s the way my application wants to receive it,”  I will suggest that
            you go and buy a book on XSLT.

         <div class="para e84">Which brings me back to 
            <div class="emphasis e85" role="ital">Balisage</div>.  This is a week that seriously stretches my imagination.  There are talks on the
            program that are on topics in which I have absolutely no interest; I’ll listen to
            some of them.  Perhaps I’ll find that I should be interested.  Perhaps I’ll find that
            I am interested.
         </div>
         <div class="para e86">In general, I have found that the more I know about anything, the more interesting
            it is.  (Except perhaps basketball.  I can’t manage to get interested in basketball
            despite working with a basketball fan.  You know, to me it’s just basketball.)
         </div>
         <div class="para e87">I suspect you will find that some of the talks at 
            <div class="emphasis e88" role="ital">Balisage</div> are “just basketball.”  You don’t have to be interested in everything, and you don’t
            have to pretend you are.  But consider going to some things you don’t think you’re
            interested in because you might be surprised.
         </div>
         <div class="para e89">This week I expect us to hear about new languages, new projects, new uses for old
            languages, new names for old technologies.  A colleague of mine recently told me that
            all the new ideas in computing are recycled and renamed from work the engineers at
            IBM did in the 1950s.  “They invented everything,” said my colleague.  For example,
            he insisted there is no such thing as “big data” — it’s just “volume.”  And all the
            things they’re inventing now to deal with big data such as link lists and indexes
            were invented in the 1950s by the guys at IBM.
         </div>
         <div class="para e90">I think he was exaggerating just a little.  But he does have a point.  We as a community
            are doing a lot of relearning, reinventing, and recycling.  I also think we are doing
            some new thinking, combining some old clothes into new outfits, knitting some new
            fabric — have I mixed enough metaphors in that sentence?  Can I get a few more in
            there if I try hard?
         </div>
         <div class="para e91">I have noticed the lifecycle of many languages seems to be similar, including many
            of the languages we’re going to be talking about here.  They grow out of a need for
            an easy way to do something. A person or a group of people find that it’s unreasonably
            difficult to do something that would be very easy with a tool that was designed to
            support what it is they want to do.  So, they design it, and some people build it,
            and users say “That’s wonderful!  But it also needs to do this and this and this to
            meet our needs.”  So they extend it.  And then more users show up and start using
            this wonderful tool … and say “But it also needs to do this and this and this.”  And
            it gets a little more flexible.  “And we need it to be a little more abstract so it
            has a little more flexibility.”
         </div>
         <div class="para e92">And before you know it, you have a turing complete language.  Cool, right?  This is
            great.  And people start using it for things the originators never imagined and that
            are completely unrelated to the original mission.  And at this point, two things happen.
            First, a group of enthusiasts start talking about using this tool or language for
            everything, eliminating the need for other languages that are older and clearly competing.
            And at the same time, some people — sometimes the same people, and sometimes different
            people — start talking about the need to simplify the language, removing features
            that are only used by a few fringe cases … like the original point of the language.
            Watch for that at 
            <div class="emphasis e93" role="ital">Balisage</div> this year.  I think we have three or four papers that are really addressing just
            that.
         </div>
         <div class="para e94">Yesterday I heard someone say “I know I can do anything I need if I have a turing
            complete language, especially one that I like.”  Well, to be more precise, it was
            Michael Sperberg-McQueen, and what he said was “I know that I can do anything I need
            if I have a turing complete language, especially one I like, like XSLT.”  So, the
            question is:  How do we decide which languages to like?  Or perhaps, how do we convince
            other people to use the languages we like instead of the languages that they already
            know and already like?
         </div>
         <div class="para e95">It seems to me that we at 
            <div class="emphasis e96" role="ital">Balisage</div> have a joint interest in markup, marked-up documents, and tools that deal with marked-up
            documents.  And one of the challenges that many of us face is convincing people who
            have had this bizarre XML stuff thrust upon them to use tools that are markup smart.
            To use the markup instead of treating an XML document as if it were a string.  Not
            that they can’t do everything they need to do using string processing tools — they
            most assuredly can.  But because that has them doing the same work two times, three
            times, four times … and maybe introducing errors.  When they are using our technologies
            incorrectly, we tend to get very angry at them.  Or we tend to feel sorry for them
            because they just haven’t been enlightened.
         </div>
         <div class="para e97">One of the things I challenge all of you to think about is how to persuasively explain
            to them that if they have markup, they ought to use it even if that means learning
            a new tool or a new way of thinking.

            I said I didn’t know enough about them to have an informed opinion.  He said, “Most
            people don’t.  But what do you think?”  He was fishing for an uninformed opinion.

         <div class="para e100">One of the joys of

            the difference, not only in other people’s informed and uninformed opinions — it really
            isn’t as simple as if they agree with you, they’re informed, and if they don’t agree
            with you, they’re uninformed — but also to challenge that in yourself.  How many of
            your opinions are informed, and how many of them are uninformed?  Can you tell the
