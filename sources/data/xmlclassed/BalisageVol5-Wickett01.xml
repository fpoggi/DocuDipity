      such an approach assumes an unambiguous mapping from tags to the logical predicates associated
      with those tags. The formal tag set description approach does not directly address how meaning
      is constructed by a reader who encounters an XML document "in the wild", especially when that
      reader was not privy to the development of the vocabulary in use by the document.  An
      overarching theory of communicative meaning like situation semantics can help us grasp the
      role that a formal tag set description plays when one is available, and see what is missing
      when that information is not available.</textual></para><para class="po-block e102 e102"><textual class="po-textual">The use of natural-language identifiers for element names allows readers to interpret

      the OAI identifier, the name of a tag alone does not always convey everything necessary to
      properly interpret the logical meaning of corresponding markup. The problems that arise for
      this kind of mis-interpretation become obvious when the markup is used to derive RDF that
      makes incorrect logical statements.</textual></para><para class="po-block e104 e104"><textual class="po-textual">The lack of access to documentation that explains the intended semantics for tags is an

      to documentation (prose or computational) that describes the resource situation against which
      markup was created, to allow readers of the documents to establish connections to interpret
      the document correctly. Without such support, interoperability across time and systems is an
