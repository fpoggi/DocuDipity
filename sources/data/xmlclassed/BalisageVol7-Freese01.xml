                        and video markup. This markup provides a standard way in which to include
                        multimedia within the EPUB files. In addition, a mechanism for adding media
                        overlays within books enables new functionality, including text highlighting
                        for read along books. This is done using the SMIL language.</textual></para><para class="po-block e61 e61"><textual class="po-textual">The adoption of the HTML5 audio and video markup is probably the most
                        familiar addition in this area. While there was little discussion around the
                        audio formats to be used (MP3 required and MP4 AAC LC suggested), there was
                        a great deal of discussion surrounding the video formats to be supported.
                        The main contenders were MPEG4 H.264 and VP8. The main point of dissention
                        was the level of support for each. Originally all reading systems were going
                        to be required to support both. However, various reading system developers
                        expressed concerns about being required to support 2 formats. There were
                        also concerns about the copyright on the H.264 format and how licensing
                        might affect reading systems. After a great deal of discussion and threats
                        of non-support if both formats where mandated, it was decided that there
                        would not be a requirement that reading systems support either format.
                        Instead, an informational paragraph was included recommending the use of one
                        of the formats, but not precluding the use of another format. In essence,
                        this will require publishers to create videos in both formats in order to
                        support the widest range of reading systems -- and hopefully no reading
                        system decides to use an alternative format.</textual></para><para class="po-block e62 e62"><textual class="po-textual">The epub:trigger element was created in order to support markup that

                        mathematical formulas were usually converted to images. The inclusion of

                        access to personal financial information which must be protected. The final
                        decision was that reading systems must provide appropriate levels of

            revise their production process to support the new format. In addition, they will need
            to determine how best to take advantage of the new functionality provided within the
            spec. This must be tempered with knowledge of what is supported across reading systems.
            Many of the new features within the specification are optional, meaning that device
            capabilities might be even broader than they are now.</textual></para><para class="po-block e136 e136"><textual class="po-textual">One of the things the working group did well was the mandate that all EPUB3 reading
            systems are required to support pre-EPUB3 files. This guarantees that current customer
            libraries will be able to be read on devices supporting EPUB3. However, there is no
            mandate for forward compatibility from current EPUB reading systems, meaning that some
            dedicated devices may begin a path to obsolescence. While it is possible that many can
            be updated via software upgrades, there are still device limitations that must be
            considered. E-Ink based displays cannot refresh quickly enough to support video, meaning
            that publishers should provide fallbacks any time they incorporate video within an
            Ebook. The video format compromise will also force publishers to create fallbacks to
            support different formats on different reading systems.</textual></para><para class="po-block e137 e137"><textual class="po-textual">At this point in time it is difficult to predict the level of support for EPUB3 from
            reading system developers. Several high profile reading system vendors were part of the
            working group, but none have made any formal announcement concerning schedules for
            releasing EPUB3 capable reading systems and apps. It seems logical that non-dedicated
            reading system vendors (such as the iPad or android tablets) might be able to be more
            agile in releasing the updates, especially the functionality around embedded audio and
            video and JavaScript. Dedicated reading systems, such as the Kindle, Nook or Kobo, do
            not have the hardware capability to support video, meaning new models of the devices
            will be required. Barnes &amp; Noble has been proactive in releasing the nookColor,
            which is capable of supporting the new multimedia capabilities.</textual></para><para class="po-block e138 e138"><textual class="po-textual">Publishers, on the other hand, will be caught between a rock and hard place, yet
            again. Conversion vendors are already receiving requests for EPUB3 support, even before
            reading systems are available. Validation software is also not available yet, making it
            very difficult to test EPUB3 files.  The timing of the final spec release (July 2011)
            will also compound problems as publisher begin to gear up for the upcoming holiday
            season, without a clear understanding of what capabilities will be available in the
            different reading systems. It would be prudent for publishers to continue to support the
            current EPUB standard in order to support the current customer base. However, there will
            also be pressure on them to begin creating EPUB3 files to take advantage of the new
            functionality and capabilities. This will result in additional cost burdens for
            publishers.</textual></para><para class="po-block e139 e139"><textual class="po-textual">At this point, it is unknown how the public will react to the release of EPUB3-based
            books. For some time, there will likely be additional confusion about which formats are
            supported on which devices. There is also some interest in how the various online
            sources will market the new files. It is anticipated that multiple choices will be
            available for the foreseeable future. How long the stores identify the different
