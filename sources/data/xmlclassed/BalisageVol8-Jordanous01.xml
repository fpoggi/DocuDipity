      were rarely a matter of straightforward translations; they tend to be variations. In later
      centuries, these collections were translated into western European languages, and their

      and although it possesses the means to identify and define semantic relationships between
      sections of text, none of these methods has, as far as we have been able to determine, been
      adopted widely or used as a standard mechanism for recording the nature of the relationship
      between texts. For instance we could use </textual><code class="po-atom e74 e74"><textual class="po-textual">&lt;ref target="..."&gt;</textual></code><textual class="po-textual"> to point to another section
      of text, but we would need to modify the schema to require that </textual><code class="po-atom e75 e75"><textual class="po-textual">@type</textual></code><textual class="po-textual"> should appear, allowing
      us to insert a description of the relationship between these two sections. Another possibility
      would be to use an </textual><code class="po-atom e76 e76"><textual class="po-textual">&lt;interp&gt;</textual></code><textual class="po-textual"> element with an </textual><code class="po-atom e77 e77"><textual class="po-textual">@xml:id</textual></code><textual class="po-textual"> attribute that contained the
      required relationship: its </textual><code class="po-atom e78 e78"><textual class="po-textual">@inst</textual></code><textual class="po-textual"> attribute could then be used to point to another section of
      text. However, the insertion of an attribute detailing the source of the asserted relationship
      (i.e. the person or bibliographic source responsible for making the assertion) is also vital
      to SAWS: we need to be able to trace the scholarly source of that link. The </textual><code class="po-atom e79 e79"><textual class="po-textual">&lt;relation&gt;</textual></code><textual class="po-textual">
      element, which is a recent addition to the TEI, provides us with the ability to include all of
      the desired information within one element: the ID of the section of text being linked from;
      the ID of the section of text being linked to; the nature of the relationship between the two
      sections; and the identity of the source responsible for making the assertion. Our use of the
      </textual><code class="po-atom e80 e80"><textual class="po-textual">&lt;relation&gt;</textual></code><textual class="po-textual"> element is discussed fully below (see ‘Use case implementation: illustrating
      the SAWS usage of TEI and RDF’), but it is worth noting in this introductory section the
      important point that the use of </textual><code class="po-atom e81 e81"><textual class="po-textual">&lt;relation&gt;</textual></code><textual class="po-textual"> allows us to enter RDF directly into the TEI
      document (i.e. the triples we are defining about the sections of text and their relationships)
      and to combine this with information about scholarly responsibility, all within one element.
      This is particularly useful when the data is being entered by scholars who are familiar with
      TEI encoding and are marking up the rest of their documents in TEI, but who do not have any
      training in RDF. Being able to enter the RDF data directly into the TEI document means that
      they do not have to learn a second set of skills, while at the same time we can make use of
      the advantages of RDF (see below, ‘Resulting benefits for information exploration and
      retrieval in the SAWS project’).</textual></para><para class="po-block e82 e82"><textual class="po-textual">These types of semantic relationships within and between texts are particularly important
      to the understanding of how themes and ideas were transmitted between cultures, and across
      languages and time. As an example use case, in the SAWS project a key point of interest to our
      manuscript scholars is to represent relationships within and between different collections of
      wise or moral sayings, and to investigate how these collections have been referred to, amended
      and/or passed on from manuscript to manuscript. We want to record and visualise the links
      within and between these collections; from these collections to their source texts (e.g.
      Aristotle’s writings); and from these collections to their recipient texts (e.g. the
      11th-century Strategikon of Kekaumenos, as well as later texts). Critically, we want to do
      this in a way which can be repeated by others, so that our collection of texts acts as an
      example and starting point for a larger enterprise taking this approach beyond our project
      alone.</textual></para><para class="po-block e83 e83"><textual class="po-textual">At the moment, scholars of </textual><emphasis class="po-inline e84 e84" role="ital"><textual class="po-textual">gnomologia</textual></emphasis><textual class="po-textual"> and their related
      texts tend to work from manuscripts and printed editions, and the links between the texts they
      are working on are recorded within commentaries and footnotes. Sometimes their editions will
      include studies of the relationships between specific manuscripts: for instance, a discussion
      of the transmission of a particular work through a number of different manuscripts. What SAWS
      will provide is the ability for scholars to investigate much more deeply the relationships
      between specific sayings within those texts, and to follow those links through a number of
      different variants and languages. This is achieved by enabling identification and annotation
      of relationships by different scholars within a ‘hub’ that will provide visualisations of
      those relationships as well as direct links to the texts concerned (or in the case of texts
      that are not digitised, a URI for that text). Scholars interested in a particular saying or
      set of sayings will immediately be able to see both the fact that the saying is related to
      sayings within other texts (each of these identifiers will be displayed to them, with a
      clickable link to that text), and will also see a description of the nature of the
      relationships that have been identified. They will also be able to view who has asserted that

      they should be described. The textual scholars involved in the project have found that the

      tagsets allowing us to mimic overlapping tags without breaking xml validation. In this example

      how a particular place of interest is described across different manuscripts, information in
      the Pleiades historical gazetteer can be consulted when constructing queries. Researchers can
      ask to see, for example, all texts that refer to that particular geographical location, even
      if the texts use different place names to refer to that geographical location (as it was often
      the case that places were referred to by different names in different historical periods). For
      SAWS, this helps with the added complication of manuscripts in different languages, with
      different character sets (compare for example Ancient Greek, Arabic). This is possible through
      examining the place names mentioned in the SAWS manuscripts in the context of the information
      in the Pleiades ontology, which gives a precise geographical reference for each place.</textual><footnote class="po-popup e367 e367"><para class="po-block e368 e368"><textual class="po-textual">Through the Pelagios networking tools, this geographical information can also be used

      schema). In particular, we are discussing with collaborators how FRBR-oo can be used to
      enhance the base ontological model for the TEI to RDF mapping, for a richer vocabulary which
      includes more detailed semantics than Dublin Core (given that Dublin Core concentrates on
