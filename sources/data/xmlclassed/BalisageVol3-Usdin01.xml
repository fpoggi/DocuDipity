    we’re talking about document modeling:  what is true versus what is useful. When you start looking at a set of
    documents, you can find a lot of things that are true about them and that you could identify and spend an awful 
    lot of money on. The question is how many of those things are useful. It would be possible, for example, when 
    marking up business documents for a subject retrieval system to identify the parts of the document on your 
    subject taxonomy and to identify the documents themselves and the chapters of them and the sections of them and 
    the paragraphs and the sentences and the words and what was the language of origin of each of the verbs in each 
    of the sentences. Is this likely to be useful? Is it conceivable that there might be somebody someplace who would 
    find that useful? Yes. If your goal is to make a corporate procedure library easily available to the telephone 
    help desk, is it likely that knowing which word is a verb is going to be helpful? Probably 
    not. So, if you’re supporting a telephone help desk, maybe you don’t need to get into the linguistic analysis of the sentences. That’s what I’m talking about:  about not supplying, not spending money to 
    do something that it is possible that some unknown future person might want. Stick to what you’re supposed 
    to be doing. There may be a text markup standard that specifies how to mark the parts of speech of each word in documents and their language of origins. If there is, and knowing or manipulating this information is related to 
    one of your project goals, then and only then, is that standard relevant to your project.</textual></para><para class="po-block e73 e73"><textual class="po-textual">I think in this talk I should also talk about </textual><quote class="po-inline e74 e74"><textual class="po-textual">good</textual></quote><textual class="po-textual"> versus </textual><quote class="po-inline e75 e75"><textual class="po-textual">useful.</textual></quote><textual class="po-textual"> It may be good to know — I’m trying to think of a good example about these same help desk documents — how many times it’s been used, who read it, and what language it was originally written in (if you’re in a multi-lingual environment).

All content published after the start date for the re-use project must be either produced in or converted to the XML format for this database and the content stored in the database. Then, editors or marketers looking for existing material they can incorporate in new products can simply search this database, find the bits they want to re-use, copy them out, and combine them with other resources from the database to make new targeted products. This means that the budget for every single publication needs to include making this XML, either from the XML they may need to produce the product-specific electronic product they are going to sell or from the typesetting files used to create their print publication. Now, for some of their content this makes sense; they have a lot of text books and reference books on the same subject matter, and specialty volumes can often be created by combining the portions of several text books and sections of reference volumes that address a specialized topic. However, there are publications that everyone knows cannot be so re-purposed, and they must participate anyway.

Oh, yeah. And they wanted it to be as compatible as possible with their existing model for a related type of materials. By that they meant that paragraphs should have the same tag, and sections should be recursive, as they were in the other documents. You know, stuff like that. Use the same list and table tagging. We sat with them for quite a while, learning about their documents, their plans for the future of their documents, the functionality they could imagine supporting in future electronic versions of their documents, the variations in their documents historically, and even how they might want to market their documents, and thus what information their marketing people might want from the documents to support marketing. </textual></para><para class="po-block e149 e149"><textual class="po-textual">We built them a </textual><emphasis class="po-inline e150 e150" role="bital"><textual class="po-textual">beautiful</textual></emphasis><textual class="po-textual"> document model, if I say so myself.

Did we compromise our principles? I don’t think so. Is the model they are using less elegant than the draft we sent them? Yes. It has some unnecessary namespaces, for example. Why? Because either the tool or the application designer (I don’t know which, and it doesn’t really matter) can’t cope with context.

However, it does no harm in the long run; all the information we modeled is still there, and if they switch to a different application that doesn’t need these namespaces, and perhaps that doesn’t want to deal with all these namespaces they can remove them. The context is still there, after all. Similarly, the XML files contain some things that are completely derived from other things in the file: Those same author names are not only stored as first name, middle initial, and surname, they are also stored in the XML file as </textual><quote class="po-inline e197 e197"><textual class="po-textual">display name,</textual></quote><textual class="po-textual"> meaning all the parts of the name, in one element, with spaces as needed. Is this harmful? No, it’s clutter. (Well, it isn’n harmful unless/until they someone updates one but not the other copy of the same information @mdash; that’s the danger of storing information twice in any format).  But apparently either the tool or the application finds it unacceptable or inefficient to concatenate the parts of the name and spaces on display. This sets my teeth on edge; it shouldn’t be in the long-term storage XML file; they are paying conversion vendors to create the same data twice (or, preferably, to put it the programmatically and charge them as if they had created it twice). Worse, they are going to ask their editors to create the same data twice, and are either going to add a validation step to ensure that the data is the same or deal with the inconsistencies that storing the same data twice creates. (If you need to store information like that in your database …) But if having it pre-assembled really makes the database or the application more efficient, or even if it simply caters to the limitations of the application developer, then it needs to be there.</textual></para><para class="po-block e198 e198"><textual class="po-textual">The Mulberry pig got passed around a few times during the process, but now everybody is happy.
