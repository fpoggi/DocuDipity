They
    are useful to the point of seeming indispensable, they are ubiquitous, and
    yet they are at the same time unwieldy and flawed. Namespace declarations
    can be inconvenient to remember, and errors in them are frequently the
    source of subtle and hard-to-diagnose errors. From a programming
    perspective, namespaces provide scope and disambiguation; from a document
    authoring perspective, namespaces provide headaches. For an HTML author,
    working in a world in which the browsers tend to suppress or auto-correct
    errors, and in which MathML, XHTML, SVG, XForms, Dublin Core and more each
    have their own namespace URI, the need to pre-declare large sets of
    namespaces quickly becomes onerous.</textual></para><para class="po-block e30 e30"><textual class="po-textual">In this paper the author proposes a simple system to simplify
    namespace declaration, and to enhance namespace functionality considerably
    by introducing a single new feature, without losing the existing benefits.
    The paper first describes in more detail some of the issues, then
    summarises the issues with requirements for change, then discusses other
    proposals, and finally makes a concrete proposal.</textual></para></section><section class="po-hcontainer e31 e31"><title class="po-block e32 e32"><textual class="po-textual">XHTML and Namespaces</textual></title><para class="po-block e33 e33"><textual class="po-textual">Consider a typical XHTML document that also uses XForms, SVG,
    MathML, and has some metadata using the Dublin Core and FOAF. Already we
    are up to six namespace declarations (including the one for XHTML) and we
    have hardly begun. SVG uses XLink adding another, and so it continues.
    Documents with twenty or more declarations are sometimes seen.</textual></para><para class="po-block e34 e34"><textual class="po-textual">Of course, many of these documents are generated automatically
    rather than hand-authored. Even there, the burden of maintaining the
    declarations should not be underestimated. To XML people familiar with the
    mechanisms and overhead of the namespace syntax there may seem (at least
    at first sight) no problem, but to HTML authors the difference is
    startling. Is it necessary?</textual></para><para class="po-block e35 e35"><textual class="po-textual">Recall that namespaces are serving two primary functions: they are
    associating names with the specifications that define them, and they are
    disambiguating in the case that two specifications define the same name.
    In practice, conflicts where the same name is defined by multiple
    specifications are rare (although still important enough to need
    addressing). For XHTML, the DOCTYPE declaration already is sufficient to
    bestow HTML-ness, and, within the context of HTML, an </textual><code class="po-atom e36 e36"><textual class="po-textual">svg</textual></code><textual class="po-textual">
    element only has one plausible interpretation. A significant motivation
    driving the use of XHTML is that XML tools can be used with the document,

    element name. One could use </textual><code class="po-atom e37 e37"><textual class="po-textual">#FIXED</textual></code><textual class="po-textual"> attributes in a document
    type definition, but we will see later why this is not a satisfactory
    approach. The HTTP MIME Content Type can also be used to indicate

    be registered with IANA, this does not scale; it also doesn't work on a
    local file system.</textual></para><para class="po-block e38 e38"><textual class="po-textual">A major goal of the work described in this paper, then, must be to

    support for renewed work on non-XML versions of HTML. These are also not
    based on SGML, but instead are an SGML-inspired format. Avowed dislike of
    XML appears to have stemmed at least in part from misunderstandings and in
    part from the stricter and more verbose syntax. For these people,
    robustness, accuracy, error detection and correctness are relatively
    unimportant: all that matters is that the Web browser render an acceptable
    result. At the time of writing, the HTML Working Group is considering
    hard-wiring MathML and SVG namespaces into the HTML specification, so that
    an </textual><code class="po-atom e43 e43"><textual class="po-textual">svg</textual></code><textual class="po-textual"> element would automatically be placed into the SVG
    namespace. This would make it harder to process the documents with other
    tools, for example it's tricky to match SVG elements with XPath or with
    XSLT match expressions if you don't know in advance whether there will be
    a namespace declaration, and, if there is, whether it will be correct. In
    fairness it should be noted that, since HTML 5 processors are expected to
    auto-correct certain classes of syntax errors which XML processors are
    required not to attempt to correct, one cannot in general expect to
    process HTML 5 documents with XML tools. None the less it is reasonable to
    be able to expect to generate HTML documents from XML, and also to use

      out that today's Web browsers reject documents containing qnames if the

      document would not be considered as well-formed without the DTD:
      progressive rendering as the document loads would have to wait for the

      Worse, since the browsers don't fetch the DTD themselves, the approach
      of defining default prefixes in a DTD can only lead to documents that
      the browsers can't load. Since our goal is to reach out and build
      bridges between HTML and XML worlds and we must (regretfully) dismiss

    the definition, and share that definition between many documents. A Web
    browser would act as if a default mix-in had been read; for older Web
    browsers this could be simulated with JavaScript. This means that if you
    want the default HTML 5 behaviour, in almost all cases you don't need to
    do anything at all; but if you want some other combination, or you need to
    extend the HTML 5 set of namespaces, you can do so easily.</textual></para><para class="po-block e125 e125"><textual class="po-textual">The second goal, minimising syntax, is necessary in order to have
    any hope of adoption by HTML and XHTML authors.</textual></para><para class="po-block e126 e126"><textual class="po-textual">People reading a draft of this paper commented that a greater
    barrier to XML adoption in the HTML world was the draconian
    error-handling, which they believed meant that a Web browser must reject
    any document that claims to be XML but is not well-formed. This is an
    unfortunate mis-perception: in fact, the restriction is that the browser
    must not claim such a resource to be a well-formed XML document, but, once
    it is not XML it is outside the scope of the XML specification, and error
    recovery is perfectly acceptable, as long as no claim is made that the
    original document is itself XML. So it seems to this author that the
    barrier is not draconian error handling, but browser writers. So, rather
    than address a problem that appears not to exist, the approach here is to
    address a real difficulty that might be pointed out as a barrier if the
    draconian error-handling straw-man were to be removed. There is no
    possibility of making the unfamiliar familiar without acquaintance, but
    first impressions count for a lot.</textual></para><section class="po-hcontainer e127 e127"><title class="po-block e128 e128"><textual class="po-textual">The Automatic Namespace Definition</textual></title><para class="po-block e129 e129"><textual class="po-textual">An automatic namespace definition file is a simple XML document.

      is encountered, it introduces a new default namespace, with the given
      URI, which will apply both to it and to all its children, unless of
      course they are themselves listed in a namespace file, or unless they
      have explicit namespace bindings in the document.</textual></para><para class="po-block e133 e133"><textual class="po-textual">This much one could do with DSRL, except that we have not used a

      can also help with other XML applications, because although currently
