            This is not sophistry: an XML document generally consists of multiple parts, and, as will be discussed further, we must
            be careful in determining the boundary of the document for the purpose of preservation. Let the term XML Document, then, in this
            paper, denote a sequence of characters represented digitally on a computer such that the sequence of
            characters satisfies the productions and constraints
            of the XML specification. We shall be neither more not less precise, but rather shall qualify or expand upon this base term as needed.
            Our definition excludes non-digital representations: if one were to print out an XML document onto paper, and then make a video of
            the paper, the video would not, by our definition, constitute an XML document.

            however long it may actually be, in any case starts now, in the present, and gradually lengthens. What is
            significant is that the people who created the document are not the people who decode it, and that the context of that decoding

                A document will be said to have been stored for a given period of time if, at the end of that time,
            the same sequence of characters can be retrieved. This definition permits changes in the encoding of the document, for example
	    from UTF-8 to UTF-16, as long as the sequence of encoded characters remains the same.
	    Our definition is also silent on whether
	    the document may be inaccessible at times during the stored period.</textual></para><para class="po-block e40 e40"><textual class="po-textual">
	    One example of a document becoming inaccessible might be

	    That is a political or social inaccessibility: the document
	    might be accessible technically, but perhaps not legally.
	    Documents can easily become technically inaccessible.
	    A promise of XML is that the format is open, and, unlike,
	    say, a proprietary word processing format, will still be
	    readable in the future. The same promise was made of
	    SGML documents, but few people make SGML software today.
	    Fortunately, software exists to convert SGML documents to
	    XML, but doing so correctly requires human expertise
	    in both formats in order to select correct options.
	    In order to retain technical accessibility, then,
	    documents may need to be migrated between formats.
	    If this is not done, however, keeping the format definition
	    along with the documents may facilitate such work after
	    a Very Long Time.
