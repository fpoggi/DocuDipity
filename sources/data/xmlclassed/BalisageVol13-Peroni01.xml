			called Range, which can (but does not have to) be associated to one or more Markup Items, which in turn may, or
			may not, refer to each other in some form. Since these annotations (and the objects they represent) are never
			embedded in the text, there are no implicit properties to consider, in particular no properties indirectly
			provided by the fragments' position in the text, relative to each other, according to document's order, etc. Thus
