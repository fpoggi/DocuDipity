Both XML itself, and the metadata schemas developed by the digital library community can be considered as cases of sociotechnical artifacts, constructions that bear within them their designers' worldview of how people within the world should appropriate and use their technology.  If we examine the metadata schemas produced by the digital library community, we find that the designers' inscription strongly favors local control over encoding practice to insuring interoperability between institutions.  If the goal of digital library interoperability is to be realized, schema designers will need to acknowledge the tension between local control and external connection using markup languages, and adjust their standard development efforts accordingly.</textual></para></abstract><author class="po-record e8 e8"><personname class="po-record e9 e9"><firstname class="po-field e10 e10"><textual class="po-textual">Jerome</textual></firstname><surname class="po-field e11 e11"><textual class="po-textual">McDonough</textual></surname></personname><personblurb class="po-container e12 e12"><para class="po-block e13 e13"><textual class="po-textual">Jerome McDonough is an Assistant Professor in the Graduate School of Library &amp; Information Science at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, where he currently serves as coordinator for the Certificate of Advanced Study in Digital Libraries degree program.

            For all of these reasons, XML-based content standards such as the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) have seen wide adoption within the library community, and librarians have been actively engaged in the development of a number of XML-based metadata standards, including Encoded Archival Description (EAD), Metadata Object Description Schema (MODS), Metadata Authority Description Schema (MADS), Metadata Encoding and Transmission Standard (METS), Metadata for Images in XML (MIX), MPEG-21 Digital Item Declaration Language (DIDL), Open Archives Initiative Object Reuse and Exchange (OAI-ORE), Preservation Metadata Implementation Strategies (PREMIS) and many others.

Perhaps more surprising is the failure of XML to ensure interoperability at a syntactic level.

        These goals convey some of the world view that XML's designer brought to bear in creating the technology.  It is clear that they saw XML as a transmission format for communications (hence the requirement that it be usable over the Internet).  They believed that XML's success was contingent upon it being flexible enough to "support a wide variety of applications."  They also clearly believed that for XML to succeed it must be easy to use, but they also recognized that the meaning of 'ease of use' is contingent upon the use one might make of the technology.  Ease of use for a document author ("XML documents shall be easy to create," "XML documents should be human-legible and reasonably clear") is a good deal different from ease of use for a software developer ("It shall be easy to write programs which process XML Documents," "The design of XML shall be formal and concise").</textual></para><para class="po-block e107 e107"><textual class="po-textual">This relatively small set of goals for the XML language was further elaborated upon by members of the original W3C XML Working Group in a variety of papers they authored to introduce and clarify XML to its potential user community.

The benefits adhering to XML's providing a standardized format include "complete interoperability of both content and style across applications and platforms; freedom of content creators from vendor control of production tools; freedom of users to choose their own views into content; easy construction of powerful tools for manipulating content on a large scale; a level playing field for independent software developers; and true international publishing across all media."  Emancipatory language is invoked repeatedly here through the use of the terms 'freedom' and 'independence,' particularly  affording users the freedom "to define new tags" and in so doing "choose their own views into content."  A key benefit to XML in this world view is the freedom it provides users to define their own structure for documents and data, using their own semantics, and to escape restrictions that software vendors (through their own inscriptions in their own products) might wish to impose on their users.

Nor did this process stop with the release of the XML 1.0 recommendation in 1998.

As the transmission format needed to support a variety of work genres (including still photographs, journals, ledgers and diaries), the elements for describing the structure of the object were highly abstract.  Drawing upon previous work done by the Text Encoding Initiative, the MOA2 DTD represented the structure of any digital library object as a series of nested &lt;div&gt; elements.  Child &lt;fptr&gt; elements underneath a &lt;div&gt; associated the &lt;div&gt; with digital content files, and a variety of XML ID/IDREF attributes were used to link &lt;div&gt; elements and content files with descriptive and administrative metadata.</textual></para><para class="po-block e146 e146"><textual class="po-textual">While the MOA2 DTD was reasonably successful, experiments with the use of the format outside the original research project revealed several deficiencies, including a lack of support for time-based media, and what was seen by members of the digital library community as an excessively restrictive model with respect to the descriptive and administrative metadata allowed within a MOA2 document.  In this latter regard, the MOA2 DTD was viewed as not living up to the promise of modular design and flexibility that should be upheld in XML schema design.  A successor effort, METS, was launched in 2001 to try to improve on the MOA2 DTD.  The METS format retained a very similar model for structuring a digital library object (with a few extensions to support time based media), but implemented a far more permissive structure with respect to descriptive and administrative metadata and was created using an XML Schema, rather than a DTD, in order to exploit XML namespaces and their further promise of modularity and schema reuse. The general structure for an object such as a digitized book in METS might look like this:

        The goal of representing the structure of a work as a hierarchy of nested &lt;div&gt; elements with TYPE attributes was to have a relatively simple, abstract hierarchical structure that could be readily applied to a variety of materials.  This was intended to promote the adoption of the standard (a single, simple standard is more likely to be adopted than a variety of complex ones), which in turn was seen as promoting interoperability.  Having all of the digital library community using a single standard for structuring content and metadata would certainly be preferable to the community adopting a variety of disparate standards.</textual></para><para class="po-block e148 e148"><textual class="po-textual">It should be noted that this move towards abstraction was a relatively significant break from the SGML design practices that many research libraries had been using to date.  While it is true that the notion of using nested &lt;div&gt; elements was derived from the TEI text apparatus, TEI does not rely on pure abstraction; one does not expect to encounter encoding such as &lt;div type="figure"&gt; in a TEI document, when a &lt;figure&gt; element is available to use.  Just as XML itself, the METS schema carries an inscription of its designers' worldview, that it was preferable to develop a single, simple, generalizable, highly abstract model and encoding mechanisms to structure content and metadata for digital library objects, rather than to pursue the development of a variety of highly specific schemas (one for photographs, one for journals, etc.), or a grand encompassing schema that contained elements appropriate to different genres that could be combined as needed (e.g., the TEI model).  Despite its use of the abstract &lt;div&gt; element with a TYPE attribute to represent the structural components of a digital library object, however, the METS schema insisted on the use of more specific concrete elements to identify different forms of metadata, with the &lt;dmdSec&gt; element used for descriptive metadata and the &lt;amdSec&gt; element used for administrative metadata, along with a series of subelements for different forms of administrative metadata (technical, rights, provenance and source).  This typification of different forms of metadata was itself an effort to promote modularity in further metadata schema development.  By identifying specific subclasses of metadata within the METS schema, METS' designers hoped to encourage XML developers in the digital library world to create discrete, specialized metadata standards that would align with those subclasses, and that those encoding digital library objects could then select from a set of such modular XML metadata standards in composing a particular object.  Through METS' design, its implementers consciously sought to encourage the adoption of modular schema design practices within the digital library community.</textual></para><para class="po-block e149 e149"><textual class="po-textual">The digital library community was obviously not the only community in the late 1990s that recognized the potential benefits of XML, nor was it the only community to develop standards for structural metadata based on this notion of a highly abstract structure.  In October of 2000, the Moving Picture Experts Group (MPEG) issued a call for proposals for "digital item declaration."  This work culminated in the release of the MPEG-21 Digital Item Declaration (ISO/IEC 21000-2) standard in 2003.  While MPEG-21 is similar to the METS standard in employing a rather abstract hierarchical structural mechanism for ordering content and metadata, it differs inasmuch as non-structural metadata (&lt;Descriptor&gt; elements in MPEG-21 parlance) are not typed, and structural metadata elements, while still rather abstract, are of three different types: &lt;Container&gt;, &lt;Item&gt; and &lt;Component&gt;.

        While it obviously uses somewhat different element names and linking mechanisms than METS, MPEG-21 DIDL follows a very similar model, and has been successfully employed by several digital libraries.  The logical structure of the object is laid out via a hierarchical arrangement of &lt;Container&gt;, &lt;Item&gt; and &lt;Component&gt; elements, and various nodes in that tree structure can be associated with metadata via &lt;Descriptor&gt; elements, and content via &lt;Resource&gt; elements.</textual></para><para class="po-block e151 e151"><textual class="po-textual">If we examine the MPEG-21 standard to determine what inscriptions its designers have placed within it regarding its use, we find messages very similar to that of METS.  Structural metadata should be highly abstract, so that a very small set of elements can be employed to structure widely disparate content genres.  While METS was perhaps more vocal in trying to push the message that further development of metadata schemas should try to create small, focused and modular metadata sets that could be drawn upon as needed to encode a particular object, MPEG-21's use of &lt;Descriptor&gt; elements that can be associated with other elements throughout an MPEG-21 document conveys the same message.  Other structural metadata standards of interest to the digital library community employ similar mechanisms.  The XFDU standard for data archiving uses hierarchies of &lt;ContentUnit&gt; elements that may be associated with &lt;dataObjects&gt; and &lt;metadataObjects&gt;.  The IMS Content Packaging standard for learning objects uses hierarchies of &lt;item&gt; elements that may be associated with &lt;resources&gt; and &lt;metadata&gt;.  While implementations differ in details, the pattern is similar and widespread across the various structural metadata standards of concern to the digital library community.  Again and again we designers seeking to achieve wide adoption of their standard in order to promote interoperability between differing institutions; to secure this goal, they favor a highly abstract structural mechanism which can be applied to a wide variety of content, and mechanisms to allow a variety of additional metadata schema to 'plug and play' within the larger structural framework.</textual></para><para class="po-block e152 e152"><textual class="po-textual">While of perhaps some limited interest to social researchers of technology, none of the preceding seems particularly surprising or problematic.

METS, in the group's opinion, was fundamentally a </textual><emphasis class="po-inline e156 e156" role="ital"><textual class="po-textual">structural</textual></emphasis><textual class="po-textual"> metadata standard; it existed to provide a framework into which other descriptive and administrative metadata, as well as content, could be placed.  The &lt;structMap&gt; element provided the tree upon which all of the other structural components of METS where hung, where the logical and physical structure of a work could be delineated, and so was really the core of a METS file and the only section that needed to be mandatory.  As the &lt;structMap&gt; was the only mandatory portion of a METS file, it was also expected that any structural description of a work should reside there; software that would process a METS file would expect to find logical or physical descriptions of the structure of a work residing within a structural map, and not elsewhere in the METS file.</textual></para><para class="po-block e157 e157"><textual class="po-textual">It was a matter of some surprise for many in the METS community, then, when the Library of Congress, which serves as the maintenance agency for the METS standard, began to produce METS files for digital versions of certain kinds of audio recordings which placed the logical structure of the works in MODS records contained within the METS descriptive metadata section (&lt;dmdSec&gt;) rather than in the structural map, and registered a profile of METS establishing this as their formal internal practice for 'recorded events' (</textual><xref class="po-milestone e158 e158" linkend="mcdo21"><textual class="po-textual">Ciao Pippo!

The first is that the implementation of highly abstract elements for the definition of structure provides a tremendous amount of flexibility to document encoders; there is a vast number of potential encodings of any given object in METS, with variations possible in depth of structure (do I limit my structure to musical movements or do I provide structural information to the measure level?), labeling (you say TYPE="book", I say TYPE="monograph"), and arrangement (should the Lord of Rings film trilogy be encoded as a single METS file?  Three METS files?  Three METS files for the individual films and a fourth representing the abstract notion of the Trilogy?).  This can lead to significant variation in encoding practices, even between two institutions dealing with remarkably similar material and using the same metadata standards, as noted by (</textual><xref class="po-milestone e167 e167" linkend="mcdo03"><textual class="po-textual">Ciao Pippo!

Ciao</textual></xref><textual class="po-textual">).</textual></para><para class="po-block e168 e168"><textual class="po-textual">The second problem is what we might call the problem of standards independence.  The various metadata schema standards which have been developed with the help of the digital library community during the past decade have all been created with the understanding that in order to ensure their usefulness in a variety of different organizations and environments, they should not contain inherent dependencies on other schemas; they need to be able to express all of the information necessary for their particular domain on their own.  For many of these standards, the designers recognized a need to be able to account for relationships between various content objects being described by the standard, whether the description being applied was the more traditional form of intellectual description you would expect in a library catalog, or a technical description of the composition of a TIFF image.  The result has been that a number of common metadata schemas within the digital library field contain elements for expressing structural metadata: Dublin Core has its &lt;relation&gt; element, MODS has its &lt;RelatedItem&gt; element, the PREMIS schema for preservation metadata has a &lt;relation&gt; element, even the MIX standard for still image technical metadata contains an element for referencing previous image metadata.  As the standards' developers felt they should not make their efforts dependent on structural metadata mechanisms in other standards, they implemented their own.  Unfortunately, with the addition of each new metadata standard containing structural metadata capabilities, the potential for difficulties with our first problem increases.  Every new metadata standard within the digital library community seems to add another mechanism for describing the structural relationships between content objects, and hence greater potential for variation in object encoding practices.</textual></para><para class="po-block e169 e169"><textual class="po-textual">The irony is that both these problems derive from the flexibility, extensibility, modularity and use of abstraction to create structural metadata elements of wide applicability that the designers of the metadata schemas hoped to promote.  The potential range of variation in encoding structural metadata is the result of each of these factors.  The use of abstraction in METS (i.e., the &lt;div&gt; element) was an attempt to make the standard flexible in application; however, it opens up a tremendous degree of play in encoding practice.  If you ask two different individuals how many page breaks there are in a text, the likelihood that they will get the same answer is a good deal greater than if you ask them how many divisions there are in a text.  The use of abstraction opens up encoding to a much greater degree of personal interpretation, and hence variation.  The extensibility of METS and the hope to promote a modular system of metadata schema reuse that its authors inscribed within it open up the possibility of using other metadata schemas to encode structural metadata.  And it was this same desire for flexibility and modularity that has led other metadata schema designers to include structural metadata components in their own schema; they wanted to ensure that their own efforts were flexible enough to be applied in a variety of settings, and with a variety of other schemas.  But having to design their own schema without knowing the specific supporting capabilities to be found in other schemas with which their own might be used, they are inevitably forced to create structural metadata capacities of their own within their schema.  The designers of metadata schemas (structural or otherwise) within the digital library community have sought to adhere to a particular set of design practices, seeking to create flexible, extensible, modular and generalized tools, and to promote like practice in others through inscription of their view of appropriate XML design within their technological artifacts.  Unfortunately, promoting such good practices has been a death blow to one of the principle reasons for adopting XML in the first place: to ensure interoperability of digital library materials across systems.  wide-scale interoperability requires wide-scale adoption, but the design practices of schema implementers intended to promote wide-scale adoption run directly counter to wide spread interoperability.</textual></para><para class="po-block e170 e170"><textual class="po-textual">Hence XML's similarity to a rope.

Through its pursuit of design goals of flexibility, extensibility, modularity and abstraction, and its promulgation of those goals as common practice through its implementation of XML metadata standards, it has managed to substantially impede progress towards another commonly held goal, interoperability of digital library content across a range of systems.  How then, should the community respond?</textual></para><para class="po-block e174 e174"><textual class="po-textual">One possible response to this situation would be to say that perhaps our community cares less about interoperability than we thought.  Despite the existence of projects such as the DLF Aquifer venture, it may be that interoperability is in fact a lower priority for the digital library community than it likes to believe, and the adoption of metadata standards that impede interoperability is merely a reflection of that underlying reality, and not a major problem to resolve.  There is at least some reason to suspect this may be the case.  Most research libraries have a clearly defined local clientele, and while voices within the digital library community have been calling for the liberation of content from local silos for some time (</textual><xref class="po-milestone e175 e175" linkend="mcdo22"><textual class="po-textual">Ciao Pippo!

If systems developed to deliver digital library content to the local community are successful in that context, and if the costs associated with achieving much more widespread interoperability are high, then many libraries may decide that interoperability, while desirable, is a goal which may have to wait.</textual></para><para class="po-block e176 e176"><textual class="po-textual">If libraries do wish to make progress on the issue of interoperability of structural metadata, they will need to recognize that, as (</textual><xref class="po-milestone e177 e177" linkend="mcdo23"><textual class="po-textual">Ciao Pippo!

Ciao</textual></xref><textual class="po-textual">), in a discussion of blogging practices, has labeled the problem of "control vs. connection."  The structural metadata standards which have been developed to date, with their emphasis on flexibility, extensibility and modularity have sought to afford local institutions the greatest degree of control possible in their encoding practices.  The standards are designed to allow any given institution to do what it wants.  This has obvious benefits in terms of easing adoption of the standard in any given context, and as a result insuring the standards' widespread adoption (obviously a good thing in a standard).  However, increasing the amount of local control over the ways in which a language is used and developed is fundamentally at odds with a language's ability to serve as a means for connection with others outside the local context.  It is, in essence, promoting the development of regional dialects at the expense of mutual intelligibility.  The particular case of structural metadata standards reveals that sufficient local variation in syntax, the ways in which people structure their objects using a markup language, can be as fatal to communication as variation in semantics.</textual></para><para class="po-block e179 e179"><textual class="po-textual">Given this fundamental tradeoff between control and connection, libraries wishing to promote interoperability of digital library content have two possible strategies.  The first, and most obvious, is to attempt to alter the balance currently struck between connection and control to more strongly favor connection.  There are several mechanisms which the library community might employ in pursuit of this strategy, including the design and use of schema which more significantly restrict both the means for recording the structure of objects and the ability to employ arbitrary additional schema within instance documents (or developing profiles of existing schema to achieve the same ends),  establishing formal rules of structural description (equivalent to rules of description used in cataloging for creating bibliographic records) dictating aspects of object encoding not susceptible to enforcement through XML's validation mechanisms, and mandating the use of particular controlled vocabularies and ontologies within document instances to record information such as a &lt;div&gt; element's TYPE attribute in METS.  Decreasing the possibility for local variation in encoding of structural metadata will certainly help improve digital libraries' capability to interoperate with each other.  However, removing local capacity for variation will also tend to reduce the number of institutions who are willing to use such a markup language.  If the digital library community, for instance, was to revise the METS standard to forbid any use of a &lt;relation&gt; or &lt;RelatedItem&gt; element in a descriptive metadata section to express the logical structure of a work, it would assist in insuring interoperability of digital content, but it might also very well mean losing the Library of Congress's support for the standard.  More importantly, however, such an approach seems to overlook one of the fundamental realities of the web environment: communities of practice no longer operate in splendid isolation from each other (if indeed, they ever did).  Even if libraries could agree on a structural metadata standard that enabled a significantly greater degree of support for interoperability than we find with today's standards, libraries must now interact with a variety of other communities (publishers, museums, archives, educational technology companies, etc.) that are also creating their own structural metadata standards.  The odds of our moving past this structural tower of Babel to achieve a single object encoding practice across all communities do not look promising, to say the least.</textual></para><para class="po-block e180 e180"><textual class="po-textual">The second, and I believe more promising, strategy is to accept that the need for local community control over encoding practices is a valid one, that regional 'dialects' of markup languages are inevitable, and that we must find ways to facilitate information exchange across the boundaries of different communities' markup vernacular.  However, this will require a significant shift in the digital library community's relationship to the notion of standards.  Specifically, I believe the library community needs to shift from its current singular focus on schema development to a dual focus on both schema development </textual><emphasis class="po-inline e181 e181"><textual class="po-textual">and</textual></emphasis><textual class="po-textual"> translation between schemas.  It is worth noting here that the Library of Congress currently serves as maintenance agency for a variety of XML standards developed within the library community; if you examine the list of standards that they are maintaining (</textual><xref class="po-milestone e182 e182" linkend="mcdo26"><textual class="po-textual">Ciao Pippo!

Ciao</textual></xref><textual class="po-textual">), however, you will find that while there are several metadata standards listed, standardized stylesheets to enable conversion between formats are not listed here.</textual></para><para class="po-block e183 e183"><textual class="po-textual">Such stylesheets do exist in some cases.  The Library of Congress has, for example, provided stylesheets to enable conversion of MODS descriptive metadata records into MARC/XML format and back.  These efforts to formalize prior work that established cross-walks between different descriptive metadata standards are not, however, seen by the community as having the status and importance of standards, as exhibited by their omission from the 'Standards at the Library of Congress' web page.  If the digital library community wishes to support interoperability while simultaneously affording institutions localized control over encoding practices, that situation needs to change.  Enabling translation activity must be seen as important, if not more important, a standards activity than the creation of schema for metadata sets.</textual></para><para class="po-block e184 e184"><textual class="po-textual">A heightened emphasis on standardizing translation between markup languages will obviously mean further work on formalizing translations between markup languages using XSLT, and treating those with the level of attention and care that the community has lavished on metadata schema.  However, it might also be worth considering whether the notion of formal rules of structural description mentioned earlier might be of benefit in trying to achieve greater translatability between different markup languages.  As an example of what this might mean, consider the example of the 1:1 principle in Dublin Core (</textual><xref class="po-milestone e185 e185" linkend="mcdo25"><textual class="po-textual">Ciao Pippo! Ciao Pippo! Ciao Pippo! Ciao Pippo! Ciao Pippo! Ciao Pippo! Ciao Pippo! Ciao Pippo! Ciao</textual></xref><textual class="po-textual">), that a single Dublin Core record should describe one and only one resource.  The 1:1 principle provides guidance on the relationship between a metadata record and a described resource that is applicable outside the realm of Dublin Core; in fact, several other descriptive metadata standards developed since Dublin Core have made reference to the 1:1 principle as a guide to usage.  We could easily envisage similar principles being developed for structural metadata that could guide usage of a variety of different structural metadata standards, and by working to insure similar use practices, would help insure ease of translation between different structural markup languages.  We might, for instance, take as a working principle that any given structural metadata document should never contain more than two levels of structural hierarchy.  Our METS example above passes muster with this rule; if, however, we modified it so that a third level of &lt;div&gt; elements was needed (of TYPE 'subchapter', for example), then we would be in violation of this principle.  To fix this problem, we could employ METS' &lt;mptr&gt; element to allow the &lt;div&gt; elements for each chapter to reference separate METS files containing the structural descriptions for the individual chapters.  Through the establishment of common principles of structural encoding and standardized stylesheets for translation, we might be able to improve our ability to interoperate while simultaneously retaining some flexibility for local encoding practice (although obviously adoption of common principles of structural encoding may impede local control in favor of connection to some degree).</textual></para><para class="po-block e186 e186"><textual class="po-textual">The rise of the network information society is presenting libraries with a variety of new challenges.  Perhaps the most significant of these is the heightened degree of interaction with communities of practice that do not share libraries' standards, practices or values.  If libraries are to survive and thrive in this new information society, they must alter their own value structure to prioritize communication with other communities to an equal, if not greater, extent than internal communication between libraries.  If they pursue this course, they may find that issues of internal interoperability of library systems are more tractable than they have appeared to date.</textual></para></section><bibliography class="po-hcontainer e187 e187"><title class="po-block e188 e188"><textual class="po-textual">Bibliography</textual></title><bibliomixed class="po-block e189 e189" xml:id="mcdo11" xreflabel="Akrich, 1992"><textual class="po-textual">
