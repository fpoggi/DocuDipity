represented by a data model or architecture: as the interpretation of
a domain and as a plan of action. XML schemas, UML diagrams, SQL
relational definitions, RDF vocabularies, and many other familiar tools
can be read both as accounts of the entities and relational properties
in a domain, and as guidelines for uniformity of naming and encoding.
These two understandings are not necessarily at odds with each other:
a specification may lay out both how its authors understand what
they're modeling and how they have agreed to maintain consistency in
expressing their data. But for purposes of promoting adoption,
one often finds more relative emphasis on either the social power of
uniform practice or on the generality of an elegant declarative
account. We may rely on one of these more than the other because it's
simply difficult to agree either on how we understand our domains or
how we'll standardize our practices (let alone both).
</textual></para><para class="po-block e41 e41"><textual class="po-textual">For an example of where we might emphasize one modeling
agenda over another, consider the application of encoding
machine-readable annotations of digital resources. In an address to a
humanities computing symposium at King's College, John Unsworth listed
annotation among seven scholarly primitives, i.e., "basic functions
common to scholarly activity across disciplines, over time, and
independent of theoretical orientation" (</textual><xref class="po-milestone e42 e42" linkend="unsworth00"><textual class="po-textual">Ciao Pippo! Ciao Pippo! Ciao Pippo! Ciao Pippo! Ciao Pippo! Ciao Pippo! Ciao Pippo! Ciao Pippo! Ciao</textual></xref><textual class="po-textual">). 
Supporting digital annotation has long been a core use case in the 
humanities, but the growing role of response and feedback in both 
online social media and digital commerce has encouraged the 
understanding of annotations as a resource genre in their own 
right. A variety of architectures have consequently been
adopted or proposed as bases for digital annotation, including HyTime

</textual><emphasis class="po-inline e55 e55"><textual class="po-textual">target</textual></emphasis><textual class="po-textual"> of the annotation. In OA, an annotation
body can be any resource that is somehow "about" another resource,
i.e., that stands in some kind of annotating relation to the target.
On the one hand, this is a descriptively general account of
annotations as a class. But  on reflection, OA's generality seems to
beg the question of what specific gap it fills in the RDF model of
resource associations. If, according to OA, annotations are sets of
related resources, what is it that distinguishes an annotation from
any other RDF description? OA's answer would seem to be that
annotations are exactly those descriptions serialized by the OA
community employing the OA vocabulary. But instead of a common
vocabulary, why not connect resources in a common architecture
across diverse RDF applications? Suppose an annotation vocabulary were
linked to specific annotating properties in local
languages—something like an  ISO 10744 enabling architecture.

Adopters of such a model would not have to convert their data to a
different serialization, for example, and the question of what exactly can
be annotated or serve as an annotation body could be governed by range
and domain constraints on local subproperties (product reviews annotating
products, footnotes annotating essays, etc.). Currently, OACG recommends
the Dublin Core Types vocabulary for typing annotation targets and
bodies, but the range of the </textual><emphasis class="po-inline e73 e73"><textual class="po-textual">hasTarget</textual></emphasis><textual class="po-textual"> and
</textual><emphasis class="po-inline e74 e74"><textual class="po-textual">hasBody</textual></emphasis><textual class="po-textual"> relations are purposefully undefined. As
a result, nothing in the current OA specifications forbids
interpretively challenging examples such as a person serving as the
annotation body for a target integer or a geographic location as the
body for a target person.</textual></para><para class="po-block e75 e75"><textual class="po-textual">On the other hand, the descriptive approach has
disadvantages as well. The OA community views </textual><emphasis class="po-inline e76 e76"><textual class="po-textual">annotations</textual></emphasis><textual class="po-textual">

properties of their own. Modeling annotations as relational instances
would therefore seem to require reification of either RDF statements or named graphs
(or the full existential quantification of first order
logic) if annotations are to stand in relations as individuals. So the
flexibility of using one's own vocabulary comes at the cost of
complexity or a requirement for greater expressive power.

contrasted in how particular regions of a resource are targeted for

systems (including XPointer, W3C Media Fragments, etc.) and organizes

But the OA specification does not make clear whether these three
categories are exhaustive, or even whether the particular methods
listed exhaust the categories (for example, whether there are area
selectors in addition to the one listed for SVG files).

complementary costs in standards adoption: that of relinquishing
full control over stipulations to a broader community vs. the complexity
necessary for generality of scope and flexibility of application. But
the language of information standards doesn't lay out this
complementarity to their audience: RDF schemas and UML 
diagrams don't announce the degree to which we should read them as
micro-theories as opposed to operational definitions.</textual></para><para class="po-block e109 e109"><textual class="po-textual">David Birnbaum presents a vivid illustration of these
competing model agendas in his 1996 recommendations for Unicode

Unicode organizes writing systems at the level of the script, rather
than the language-specific alphabet or orthography, but specifies that
characters convey distinctions in sound or meaning. As Birnbaum points
out, orthographic systems that share the same script may assign
different sounds or meanings to the same grapheme. The range of
languages, regions, and time periods covered in Cyrillic materials
scholarship therefore challenges Unicode's representational weakness
in ways that typical business uses do not. But, as Birnbaum explains,
although distinctions important to Slavic scholars may not always be
straightforward to express in Unicode, the "academic and computational
chaos and parochialism" that preceded Unicode's introduction lead to
even more difficult text rendering and processing problems. Therefore
Birnbaum's proposed encoding guidelines for Cyrillic texts address a
range of problems for Slavic scholarship, while keeping Unicode's
standardization and uniformity. This article is a rare example of
making clear both the descriptive limitations of an architecture and
the attraction of workarounds for leveraging the power of simply
getting on board despite the problems.</textual></para><para class="po-block e111 e111"><textual class="po-textual">Although the Open Annotation specifications don't lay out
descriptive/prescriptive tensions as directly, details that may seem
at first like semantic infelicities make more sense from a cohortative
perspective. OA is primarily a set of encoding guidelines, not a
theory of annotation. One adopts the Open Annotation Data Model for
the value of participating in a collective enterprise, and reads the
specification as a record of the working group's decisions. The
promise of OA lies more in prospects for social success than in the
model's descriptive power.

activities—even formal aspects like data modeling. Decisions on
which standards to adopt require that we weigh different kinds of
costs against each other (e.g., complexity vs. stipulation costs).
These decisions take place against a backdrop of social factors that
usually aren't documented in standards or discussed in their
supporting literature. But each conceptual framework, layered
architecture or RDF schema we're offered has something to assert about
how things are, and some plan to propose on how to proceed.</textual></para></section><section class="po-hcontainer e113 e113"><title class="po-block e114 e114"><textual class="po-textual">Acknowledgments</textual></title><para class="po-block e115 e115"><textual class="po-textual">This research was supported by </textual><emphasis class="po-inline e116 e116"><textual class="po-textual">Libraries:
