as it were, depends on extensive testing of its component parts and
assemblies. The record for products of the Y-12 National Security
Complex has for many years been in the form of lengthy paper documents.
Recently we have begun a process to capture some of this information
in XML documents. However, this is not simply another XML publishing
project. Because our products have a potentially very long shelf life
and we cannot foresee the computing environment in their distant future
existence, we must take extraordinary measures to document not only
the products themselves but also the environment in which the documentation
has been prepared. Adding complexity to this documentation challenge
is a parallel effort to capture the output data of test equipment
and wrap it in XML. While this project is very much a work in progress,
we can see that one major component of its possible success will be
the coordination of complex metadata.</textual></para></abstract><author class="po-record e8 e8"><personname class="po-record e9 e9"><firstname class="po-field e10 e10"><textual class="po-textual">D.</textual></firstname><othername class="po-field e11 e11"><textual class="po-textual">Matthew</textual></othername><surname class="po-field e12 e12"><textual class="po-textual">Kelleher</textual></surname></personname><personblurb class="po-container e13 e13"><para class="po-block e14 e14"><textual class="po-textual">Matthew Kelleher has a B.S. in chemical engineering from Iowa

Unlike other industrial products, such as automobiles and computers,
Y-12's finished work cannot be tested in use. Instead, we must assure
our customers that the products we send them are made precisely according
to specifications, using approved procedures. Not only can the products
not be tested in use, they typically remain in the stockpile inventory
for some decades, so assurance of what went into an individual unit
and how all the components were assembled is important for continued
customer assurance (no mere 5 years/50,000 mile warranty here). And
when an individual unit comes back to us, either to be refurbished
for life extension or to be dismantled at the end of its life, we
need to know exactly what was in it and how the components were assembled.</textual></para><para class="po-block e42 e42"><textual class="po-textual">Because we think in long product lifetimes for these products
that are not easily opened for inspection (you can't just lift the
hood and check the oil), each individual product is accompanied by
extensive documentation. A typical component will undergo numerous
certifications, including tests of the chemical and physical properties
of its materials and inspections of the part itself for dimensions,
surface finish, and contaminants. Each step in the assembly process
is accompanied by more tests and X-rays for alignment of components,
finished dimensions, and other properties. All the test results, checklists,
instrument printouts, and other materials gradually accumulate into
a bulky record that is kept until the individual device is dismantled,

CMMs can perform exceedingly precise tracings of surface contours
and generate electronic data. At some future phase of this project
we hope to merge CMM data directly into the DCR, but for the present
it will be entered into the report by the inspector at a terminal
beside the machine. (Our CMMs are massive instruments: to achieve
the necessary precision, their work tables and supporting beams are
massive blocks of granite because steel I-beams are too flexible,

with fluorescent dyes that can help make visible minute cracks in
welds or metal parts. </textual><xref class="po-milestone e46 e46" linkend="boo"><textual class="po-textual">Ciao Pippo! Ciao Pippo! Ciao Pippo! Ciao Pippo! Ciao Pippo! Ciao Pippo! Ciao Pippo!

process; it is also a procedure for carrying out the process, with
the results captured in forms in the body of the procedure. Thus,
a potential reader some years in the future can see not only that
a product has been certified but the steps that were taken in the
process to certify it. As an XML document, the DCR is not particularly
exceptional; it has the typical components of technical documents:
sections, titles, paragraphs, lists, tables, figures. Its most unusual
feature is the tabular presentation of the steps in the procedure,
intermixed with spaces to capture user input as the steps are carried
out. The NDT is simpler than the DCR, but it, too, captures data on
a form. The procedure for the NDT is a separate document, and the
form is for data capture only. (Each DCR procedure is unique to an
individual component, but NDT procedures are generic to many components.)</textual></para><para class="po-block e54 e54"><textual class="po-textual">What is more interesting than the forms as examples of XML documents
is the workflow associated with the creation and use of the these
procedures/reports and its implications for configuration management.
In their paper format, DCRs in particular have always been under many
layers of configuration control. A typical DCR contains one or more
“Picture Pages” that contain drawings of the component being certified,
followed by the testing procedure. Both the Picture Page and the procedure
require sign-offs by a Product Engineer and an Inspection Engineer,
who are responsible for the manufacture and testing of the component,
and a configuration control officer, who releases the procedure to
the certification laboratory under a Product Engineering Transmittal
(PET). The process of developing, approving, and releasing an individual
DCR procedure is well established and governed by its own controlled
procedures. </textual></para><para class="po-block e55 e55"><textual class="po-textual">In developing an electronic workflow, we are constrained by
the PET process. However, behind it we must develop additional layers
of configuration control on the components of the XML processing.
Even though SGML, XML, and related software have been evolving in
the industrial documentation sector for more than a quarter of a century,
they are still young in the eyes of those in the NWC. Our configuration
control must not only account for the requirements of software development,
they must also meet the requirements of our customers, most of whom
are not computing specialists, much less XML experts. One consequence
of the PET process is that we must closely mirror the process for
paper documents, and the electronic document must capture the metadata
associated with the paper one that has been accepted by the user community. </textual></para><para class="po-block e56 e56"><textual class="po-textual">Behind that, however, we must also maintain a high level of
configuration control for the XML and processing components. Because
the potential lifetime of certification data for a product is longer
than the past history of structured markup, we must attempt to anticipate
what will be needed to recall certification data when an individual
product returns for refurbishment or dismantlement some day in the
future, when everyone who is working either on the current XML project
or who participated in the certification on the shop floor has retired.
Thus the files that record results of certifications must record audit
trails not only of the certification process but also of the XML and
its processing behind the creation of the files. Only when we are
able to integrate all of these processes and data flows into an integrated
archive will we be able to say that we have implemented an Electronic
Build History (EBH).</textual></para><para class="po-block e57 e57"><textual class="po-textual">The life cycle that we are incorporating into this project is
only one of the possibilities we examined. We also looked at a system
for scanning user input on paper forms and a manufacturing execution
system that would place the entire process under electronic control.
Scanning, we decided, was actually too difficult: intelligent character
recognition systems, it seems, place too many constraints on their
input forms. They fit best in environments where there are large volumes
of a very few forms, which is the opposite of our situation. A manufacturing
execution system (MES), we know from our own tests, could be programmed
for our workflow. Because our current MES is very old and does not
have good data collection capabilities, Y-12 is looking at replacing
it. Although the replacement MES will take time to implement, it may
have appropriate data collection capabilities. Thus a workflow built
around an XML publishing system with extensive scripting and an attached
Web server represents a middle path for capability and costs.</textual></para></section><section class="po-hcontainer e58 e58"><title class="po-block e59 e59"><textual class="po-textual">The DCR Life Cycle</textual></title><para class="po-block e60 e60"><textual class="po-textual">The certification process captured by the DCR is a late step
in an overall manufacturing workflow that begins with a product specification
issued by a Design Agency (DA, typically Los Alamos National Laboratory
or Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory). At Y-12, that specification
becomes the responsibility of a Product Engineer (PE), who oversees
its interpretation into manufacturing processes on the shop floor
and then certification procedures for validating the results of manufacturing.
The manufacturing process for an individual component may be complex,
involving many steps, each with its own associated tests. A casting,
for example, may be turned to a rough shape, then gradually machined
to a final shape before being submitted for final certification. At
every step there are additional tests. Certification itself is often
iterative: a part that is slightly off-tolerance will be returned
to manufacturing for further refinement, perhaps several times, until
it is able to meet all requirements of the certification. As each
test is completed, the results and the reports are audited before
the manufacturing step is certified. The various test reports, such
as the DCR and NDT, will accumulate with each part and assembly, being
accumulated into a build history that forms part of the certification
documentation of a product.</textual></para><para class="po-block e61 e61"><textual class="po-textual">The certification process is overseen by an Inspection Engineer
(IE), who works with the PE to ensure that the tests are adequate
to capture the specification of the component. Development of an inspection
procedure is also iterative; when it is complete, the document must
be signed by both the PE and the IE, as well as an engineer responsible
for configuration control. The typical DCR, having both a part drawing
and a testing procedure, has separate signature records for both.</textual></para></section><section class="po-hcontainer e62 e62"><title class="po-block e63 e63"><textual class="po-textual">Constructing a DCR in XML</textual></title><para class="po-block e64 e64"><textual class="po-textual">Our current practice is for a DCR to be generated in Microsoft
Word and for the results to be printed. The testing procedure consists
of steps, each of which describes a test process and lists the tools

a row in tabular form, also provides a space to record the results,
which may include pass/fail indicators, direct observations or measurements
from test equipment, and comments or even sketches from the inspector.

past practice, because the information flow forks: The XML document
is converted to an HTML (actually JSP) procedure and form for online
delivery to the inspector, while a copy of the file is reserved for
population with data later in the process. The inspector on the shop
floor uses a Web browser to enter data into a new instance of the
online form. At the end of the inspection, the data is collected in
another XML file that is then merged with the empty copy of the procedure
to produce the actual certification report. At that point the completed
procedure is audited. If the part is not approved, it is returned
to manufacturing for further work, followed by more inspections, until
the part is either finally approved for this stage or it is “killed”
and its materials perhaps recycled. If the part is approved, based
on the data collected, the completed XML report is archived. Our current
view is that there will actually be at least three objects archived:
the first is the XML data file collected from the online process,
the second a merged XML file containing the DCR in the form of the
template populated with the collected data, and the third a PDF file
of the completed DCR report created by merging the data file with
the form. Moreover, until the EBH has been certified as a valid process,
the DCR report must be produced in paper. For this reason, as well
as for the comfort of our customers, we have taken special care to
produce the DCR in a format that closely approximates that of the
current Word documents. Using a form that looks like their current
form also makes it easier to meet Y-12's conduct-of-operations requirements.</textual></para><para class="po-block e89 e89"><textual class="po-textual">This workflow contains most of the expected components associated
with XML-based publishing. Behind the XML documents there are, of
course, DTDs. (We use DTDs and not some other form of schema largely
for consistency with other local applications.) Conversion to HTML
forms and merging data collected online back into the XML record is
handled by XSLT. Because we use the Arbortext publishing system, both
screen presentation and formatting for PDF are handled by Arbortext's
proprietary stylesheets, which are, at least, also XML documents.</textual></para><para class="po-block e90 e90"><textual class="po-textual">When we started on the project, our early goal was to find out
whether we could recreate the DCR document in an XML publishing system.
Having done the document analysis, written a DTD, and created a stylesheet,
we concluded that the basic document was within our capabilities.
Then the process expanded into the scripts that create the HTML form
pages, collect the data from the forms, and populate a completed XML
document. That being done, and a parallel process for the NDT form
likewise undertaken, we could have considered our project complete.
However, these reporting forms do not exist in a vacuum. The data
recorded on a DCR, in particular, does not all come from human observation;
it may come from test equipment, though it currently must be entered
manually. In many cases the component being tested may also be undergoing
a surface contour trace on a CMM, and the CMM is producing a data
file. For some years, DOE has been requiring that such data become
part of an “Electronic Data Capture” (EDC) record. Heretofore, the
EDC file has probably been in a proprietary format or in a record
format that does not involve XML. CMM measurements and reports are
not entered in or handled as DCRs, and current CMM reports have their
own defined paper and electronic formats. CMM paper reports are placed
in the build history and electronic versions are saved in the plant
EDC system. Now, however, we are beginning to look at the potential
for merging data entered by the inspector with EDC data from test
gear and creating a complete XML record of the certification process.
DCRs are used for many kinds of measurements not performed using CMMs
and for which EDC is not currently performed. Future development of
an EBH may cause rethinking of the kinds of reports generated, the
formats of the data, and the relationship between the reports and
the results of EDC.</textual></para><para class="po-block e91 e91"><textual class="po-textual">Building the XML environment for EDC is in only the very earliest
investigatory stages. We know that some data, such as series of coordinates
from CMMs, could be recorded as simple XML records. Other data, such
as signal output from a vibration analyzer, will probably need to
remain in binary format. Our challenge, then, will be to create a
layered data/metadata environment that will accommodate a variety
of test equipment as well as a variety of users and uses for the data
over the long life span of the product. We are investigating this
environment with other users of such test equipment, most of them
outside the NWC. At the innermost layers of the metadata onion, next
to the core of data from the test gear, will need to be metadata about
the equipment in use, such as the identification of the device and
its calibration record. Around that will be layers that describe the
specific test environment, such as the time, date, and environmental
conditions in the test shop. Another layer will include the identification
of the component under test and link the specific test to the record
being created in the DCR.</textual></para></section><section class="po-hcontainer e92 e92"><title class="po-block e93 e93"><textual class="po-textual">Tracking the Workflow</textual></title><para class="po-block e94 e94"><textual class="po-textual">Much of the problem of assembling an EBH is a result of the
need to track both the actual certification data and the metadata
about the data-collection process and to keep all of this information
in synchronization. Furthermore, the process must continue to support
the workflow that has been built up—and certified—around the paper-based
process. The layers of configuration management that have accumulated
around the PET process are concerned with tracking paper documents.
Now we need to embed configuration management into the documents themselves
and make them as self-documenting as possible. This seems to suggest
that at each stage of processing the document should accumulate additional
metadata, so that when the report, which represents the procedure
completely populated with certification data, is finished, it is also
fully populated with an audit trail of the processes that allowed
it to be completed. Thus the metadata will accumulate in layers, one
of which captures the traditional PET and audit processes and the
others which track the XML environment.</textual></para><section class="po-hcontainer e95 e95"><title class="po-block e96 e96"><textual class="po-textual">Files, Locations, and Management</textual></title><para class="po-block e97 e97"><textual class="po-textual">In a conventional XML document-management environment, the goal
is frequently to get to a final document. In that case, it is the
document instance that will be archived. It may be of interest to
archive the DTD or other schema if that will help in further interpretation
of the document, but for many applications a well-formed document
may, as some have argued, be sufficient. If a document, such as a
maintenance manual, is revised iteratively, then continued maintenance
of its DTD and other supporting structures like stylesheets becomes
more significant than in cases where the document is a final product.
In our case, however, the entire processing stack becomes a structure
subject to audit and thus to archiving. When we face the possibility
that a generation from now it will be necessary to verify that an
electronic document is what was intended originally, we need not only
the document and its graphics but many of the process files that supported
them.</textual></para><para class="po-block e98 e98"><textual class="po-textual">The document-management system for our process is not yet established
because it will have to be coordinated with other systems outside
our current scope. Currently a DCR template is created on a local
PC. For the interim, document processing and storage are on a Web
server (see below, Table 1). Even after primary storage systems are
established, copies of the files will continue to appear on that system.
Processing of a new DCR form begins with loading the DTD, template,
composition stylesheet, and XSLT stylesheets to the server. The server
then establishes links for starting certifications using that template.
The inspector can call forth an online form, enter metadata about
the part being tested, and walk through the procedure, entering data
as required. When the procedure is completed, the results can be saved.
The individual certification run can be reopened for further editing,
or the results can be composed as a report and sent for auditing and
approval.</textual></para><para class="po-block e99 e99"><textual class="po-textual">At the current stage in the development of the process, we are
not completely certain of all the items that will be tracked, but
our current analysis suggests that we have a complex of items in the

the software behind them, we start with a small number of control
files, build a form package, and then collect a data package. Source
files are to be archived in a content-management system and final
results will be passed to a data repository. Almost all the files
pass through the Web server, where source XML is rendered into HTML/JSP
forms, data is collected through the forms, and results are assembled
in XML and PDF. One auxiliary server hosting composition software
is called in to manage PDF rendition of XML files. Software source
code, such as the backing bean module and DOM-based interpreter of
JSP output, will also be managed, probably on a content-management
system.</textual></para><para class="po-block e313 e313"><textual class="po-textual">Some files in the system are, in effect, transient and so do
not require archiving. The JSP version of a procedure and form is
created when an IE creates a new or revised procedure and loads it
to the Web server. It is displayed to guide the inspector through
the certification process and collect input from the process, but
it is not saved with data in place. Creation of a new XML data file
from what is entered in the online form is hidden from the user until
that data is merged with the XML form template and displayed as a
PDF rendition. </textual></para></section><section class="po-hcontainer e314 e314"><title class="po-block e315 e315"><textual class="po-textual">Metadata Flow</textual></title><para class="po-block e316 e316"><textual class="po-textual">Because the EBH project builds on legacy processes and incorporates

a dual flow of metadata.</textual></para><para class="po-block e317 e317"><textual class="po-textual">The XML component of the EBH study began with a pilot project
to capture a DCR as an XML document rather than as a Word file. One
of the first decisions in the document design was to create specific
elements to capture metadata already in the paper-based workflow.
So there are individual elements to both information about the component
being certified and the engineers involved in developing and approving
the certification and reporting procedure. The component itself is
identified on the template form by its part number and name. When
the certification procedure is executed, the inspector will add to
these the lot number and serial number of the part. The Picture Page
also includes the governing drawing number. The approvals include
elements for the PE, IE, and configuration engineer, along with the
dates of their approvals and the PET governing the procedure. There
are separate approvals for the Picture Page and the body of the procedure.
These elements of the template are simply passed through the entire
process to the final certification report unchanged. They are rendered
in both HTML and PDF, but appear in the XML version of the report
just as they appeared in the template XML created by the IE.</textual></para><para class="po-block e318 e318"><textual class="po-textual">The IE will recognize that the new workflow calls out this legacy
metadata as explicit items for input, rather than finding it simply
as locations in a Word table to fill in. (We are still developing
the user interface to be used in the Arbortext editor.) But beyond
that, these items will not be recognized as metadata by users of the
process. The information will, for all practical purposes, continue
to look as it did in the paper-based process. Because the information
is wrapped in XML, however, it will be available to future processes
that for the most part have not yet been created.</textual></para><programlisting class="po-block e319 e319" xml:space="preserve"><textual class="po-textual"> &lt;DCRbody&gt;

in the HTML/JSP files and attributes on the metadata appendix of the
merged XML DCR. Because the HTML/JSP files are transient generated
objects and not archival artifacts, their metadata is less important
than that of the XML files. Nonetheless, we have the information available
in case we need it. We do write the name of the Web form into the
data-collection file and copy that into the DCR.</textual></para><para class="po-block e327 e327"><textual class="po-textual">In addition to version information, we also capture data about
each “inspection event.” In traditional processing, each inspection
of a part is a unique event. If the part passes the inspection (or
is granted a “deviation” waiver from some portion of the specification
being tested), a report is completed and sent to auditing. If the
part fails, it is either “killed” or sent for rework, and the form
being completed is discarded without becoming a report. Because the
overall process for electronic histories is still in early phases
of investigation, we have not constrained ourselves to this model.
Instead, our process allows for checkpointing a version of the collected
data and reopening the form for revision, starting with the saved
inspection data. Even if the future workflow continues the current
model of each inspection being unique, the ability to reopen a file
allows the inspector or auditor to correct errors in data entry. In
any event, we record data from each time the file is opened, including
the person opening the file, a timestamp, and the disposition of the
inspection (whether the part has been accepted or has failed). This
data, together with other metadata from the process flow, is accumulated
in the “Inspection Record” appended to the DCR.</textual></para><programlisting class="po-block e328 e328" xml:space="preserve"><textual class="po-textual"> &lt;LotInspection&gt;
