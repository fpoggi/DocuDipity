                publishing workflow, it must embody two virtues: It must have a very shallow
                learning curve, because the majority of users will be encountering it for the first
                time, and they may have no knowledge whatsoever of XML. It must also have a
                comprehensive and accurate change-tracking feature that allows editors to accept and
                reject changes without breaking the XML. A system designed for a publication
                services company with many publisher-customers must have the additional virtue of
                being highly customizable to account for wide variations in journal styles and the
                particular needs of online hosts.</textual></para><para class="po-block e9 e9"><textual class="po-textual">To achieve usability, we based ProofExpress on LiveContent Create (formerly

                users in the creation of more complex XML structures. Our change-tracking feature
                employs denormalization of nested elements to granularly expose all edits and a rule
                engine that protects the structure of the XML by governing the order of acceptance
                and rejection of edits. XML configuration files control the content of the nodes

No longer did
            proofs need to be printed out and either mailed or faxed to the author for correction.
            The PDF could be delivered instantly over the Internet, and the author could view and
            annotate the PDF on a computer in a different environment, using a different operating
            system. (Of course, that does not stop them from printing the pages out, correcting them
            by hand, and mailing or faxing them back.) The question then becomes, how can we bank
            the gains that were made in delivery and interoperability and take them to the next
            level? The answer, of course, is online XML editing.</textual></para><para class="po-block e42 e42"><textual class="po-textual">The clearest advantage of an online, XML-based proofing system is that everyone
            involved can work on the same document from copyediting through final corrections. This
            stands in contrast to PDF-based proofing, where authors and editors may mark up
            different PDFs, which are then given to a typesetter to transfer the corrections.
            Sources of error at this stage include the misinterpretation of sometimes ambiguous
            corrections and the rekeying itself (</textual><link class="po-inline e43 e43" xlink:actuate="onRequest" xlink:href="http://www.councilscienceeditors.org/files/scienceeditor/v27n5p155.pdf" xlink:show="new" xlink:type="simple"><textual class="po-textual">http://www.councilscienceeditors.org/files/scienceeditor/v27n5p155.pdf</textual></link><textual class="po-textual">). A
            new PDF is then generated, and another review cycle is initiated. PDF proofing is thus
            both inefficient and prone to error due to the degree of manual intervention. As
            attractive as an XML-based proofing system can seem from a workflow standpoint, however,
            it will come to nothing unless it is adopted. An online, XML-based article proofing
            system designed for science, technical, and medical (STM) journals must be easy to use
            for authors, editors, and publishers and maintain the XML in good shape for the
            typesetting system and the online providers that host the resulting content.</textual></para><para class="po-block e44 e44"><textual class="po-textual">Authors of STM journal articles can be many things--researchers, engineers, students,
            doctors. One thing they often are not is readers of instructions. (Many jobs in
            publishing, from copyeditors to developers of editorial software, depend on this fact.)
            In addition, authors may not be especially eager to learn new software. When Dartmouth
            Journal Services (DJS) instituted PDF annotation as our preferred method of proof
            review, many authors pointed out that they had written their paper in MS Word and did
            not appreciate having to learn how to use the annotation tools in Acrobat Reader. (We
            use eXtyles to apply structure to authors' Word files. After copyediting, we again use
            eXtyles to export JATS XML.) So, the ideal system will give authors a set of tools
            similar to those they are accustomed to in word processing programs.</textual></para><para class="po-block e45 e45"><textual class="po-textual">Editors must review the corrections made by authors, and to do so, they need an
            accurate change-tracking mechanism. In addition, they need a way to accept or reject the
            changes that an author has made to their proof. A likely solution, and the one we tried
            first, is XML differencing. However, XML differencing must work around the longest
            common subsequence problem
            (</textual><link class="po-inline e46 e46" xlink:actuate="onRequest" xlink:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longest_common_subsequence_problem" xlink:show="new" xlink:type="simple"><textual class="po-textual">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longest_common_subsequence_problem</textual></link><textual class="po-textual">).

            differencing can only tell you how two versions of a piece of text are different, it
            cannot tell you what was done to make the versions different. Thus, editors would be
            faced with accepting or rejecting these differences, not the actual edits made by the
            author.</textual></para><para class="po-block e48 e48"><textual class="po-textual"> A problem particular to publication services companies is accommodating the wide

            They are silent, for example, on questions of what symbols to use in footnotes, whether
            to use numbered or author-date reference citations, and whether items in ordered lists
            should have labels or not. Another complication arises from the needs of the different
            online hosts that a publication services company must deliver XML to. One online host
            may require that a &lt;glossary&gt; appear within the &lt;back&gt; element, whereas another

            Editors must have the ability to see exactly what corrections authors have made, not
            only to ensure that these corrections conform to journal style, but also to confirm that
            the authors have made no changes to data or to claims that would require the article to
            undergo another round of peer review. A great advantage can be gained if the

            tracking feature, but it's features are rather limited. It tracks insertions and
            deletions, but not formatting changes. In fact, as we discovered when we tried to build

                of the difference between the original and edited versions of the text, but it may
                not tell us what the author actually did. For example, if an author changes the
                sentence "I say cheese to you" to read "I say oh pleeze to you", the engine will

                original file and the edited version, but actually records what the author did, we
                used the extensive set of event handlers in LiveContent Create to add custom
                elements to the XML on the fly. Doing so turned out to be rather more difficult than
                it first seemed, as there can be many ways to perform the same edit. For example,
                there are many ways to delete text. You can delete character-by-character using the
                Backspace or Delete keys. You can select a text range and use Backspace or Delete.
                You can select and Cut or select and type over. All of these methods of deletion
                should be presented in the same way to the user, but they had to be dealt with
                individually through the event handlers.</textual></para><para class="po-block e101 e101"><textual class="po-textual">The changes that we made to the JATS schema to accommodate our track changes
                feature reflect the different ways an edit can be performed as well. Again using the
                example of deletion, the LiveContent Create event handlers provide different
                information depending on whether deletions are done to a block of text at once or
                are done character-by-character and, in addition, whether the text being deleted
                contains a formatting node or not. As a consequence, we use one deletion tag for
                deletions that are done character-by-character and contain formatting nodes and
                another tag for deletions done to blocks of selected text or text that does not
                include a formatting node. Another modification of the JATS schema is the addition
                of "unformatting" nodes. If a user makes text bold, the system naturally adds a
                &lt;bold&gt; tag. If another user removes the formatting from that text, an &lt;unbold&gt;
                tag is applied.</textual></para><para class="po-block e102 e102"><textual class="po-textual">When the track changes elements are added to the XML, a set of attributes are

                example of different users toggling on and off formatting, the element reflects the
                current state of the formatting while attributes contain the history of how the
                current state was arrived at. These attribute values also inform the XSLTs that are

            the casing of headings to the italicization of foreign words. Many of these differences
            must be accounted for in ProofExpress. For example, some journals use numbered citations
            while others use author-date citations. Among those that use author-date citations, some
            list one author before "et al." while others list six, some place a comma before the
            year while others do not, some put citations in brackets while others put them in
            parentheses, etc. The tool used for adding and editing citations must know not only the
            correct elements and attributes to add, it must know what the text content of the
            citation will be. Adding an additional level of complication, DJS delivers XML to

            The files are easily generated and allow very granular control of elements of style. Use
            of configuration files obviates the building and maintenance of a complex administrative
            interface. New elements can be added as new configuration points are uncovered. As a
            bonus, we are looking into developing XSLTs that will pull information from these

            challenge. ProofExpress must let users with no prior knowledge of XML easily make any
            possible edit. It must track every change, and give editors a tool to review the changes
            and accept or reject each one individually without breaking the XML. The same tools used
            across all journals must be configured to output different XML to accommodate the styles
            of each.</textual></para><para class="po-block e145 e145"><textual class="po-textual">The rewards of having such a system are great as well, and we may eventually expand
            its usage to copyediting (though not to authoring; we have no control over authors until
            their articles are accepted and in our production workflows). By allowing all work to be
            done on a single file, ProofExpress increases efficiency as it removes potential sources
            of error. Schematron validation can be applied during the correction cycle instead of
            after back-end conversion, when the errors it uncovered would be more expensive to fix.
            In addition, having such a system opens up new possibilities in the journal production
            workflow. Notably, ProofExpress enables us to add fully automated page generation to our
            workflows, even when the system that creates the PDF cannot "round-trip" the XML. A new
            PDF of the article can be generated at any stage, simply by feeding the revised XML to
            the page-generation system. This capability puts the entire production process where it
            should be, in the hands of authors and editors.</textual></para></section></article></classedDocument>
