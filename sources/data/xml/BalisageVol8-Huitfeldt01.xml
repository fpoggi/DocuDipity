                view that documents are abstract objects with the fact that they can undergo change.
                In this paper we present an account of documents which we believe is quite common,
                but which was not discussed by Renear and Wickett. </para><para>According to this account documents are indeed abstract objects, but this is
                easily reconciled with the fact that they are created and can undergo change. We
                then point to a similarity between this account and the notion of so-called
                space-time slices. We argue that the proposed account of documents as timed abstract
                objects may be subject to the same kind of criticism that has been raised against
                the notion of space-time slices. </para><para>We believe that our account fares no worse than the other accounts given of
                documents as abstract objects. But it still fails, and we remain agnostic about the
                ontological status of documents and their relation to abstract objects, as well as
                about the nature of abstract objects. We conclude that either documents are not (or
                not related to) abstract objects, or they are (or are related to) abstract objects
                of a kind which does not correspond to the standard definition of what an abstract
                object is.</para></abstract><author><personname><firstname>Claus</firstname><surname>Huitfeldt</surname></personname><personblurb><para>Claus Huitfeldt is Associate Professor at the Department of Philosophy of the

            expression occupy an ambiguous and philosophically interesting position between the
            concrete and the abstract. On the one hand, they become known to us only in the form of
            concrete physical objects like books, scores or performances. On the other hand, it
            seems unnatural to identify the works with their manifestations: A literary work is not
            identical with any sum of physical manifestations, and a musical work is identical
            neither with its score nor with its performances. </para><para>Questions concerning the ontological status of literary or musical works fall within
            the wider domain of questions concerning the ontological status of other cultural or
            artistic expressions such as for example sculpture or painting, and also within the even
            wider domain of questions concerning the status of cultural artifacts in general. Our
            discussion in this paper is limited to the realm of writing. </para><para>Following Goodman [<xref linkend="Goodman76"/>], we may distinguish what may be called
            "unique" from "multiple" art forms by appeal to his definitions of autographic and
            allographic works.
            <!--This captures fairly well an intuition that sculptures and paintings
            are unique in a sense which literary or musical works are not-->.
            Roughly, and limiting ourselves to modern Western culture, literary and musical works
            are based on notations and are therefore allographic, whereas sculptures and paintings
            are non-notational, and therefore autographic. No copy of Mona Lisa or replica of David
            is an authentic manifestation of Mona Lisa or David, whereas any edition of Hamlet or
            performance of Bolero is a manifestation of Hamlet and Bolero, respectively. In the
            former case, the authenticity of a manifestation is a question of physical identity. In
            the latter case, no question of authenticity in terms of physical identity applies.
            Whether a copy is a manifestation of a literary or musical work is only a question of
            correctness of reproduction within certain constraints. </para><para>Thus, the identity criteria for autographic works are similar to the identity criteria
            for physical objects. The identity criteria for allographic works are slightly more
            difficult to specify. What is it that makes two physical objects manifestations of the
            same document? <footnote><para>So far, we have talked about musical and literary "works". From this point on,
                    we will talk mainly about "documents": This may be slightly confusing, as many
                    writers on this subject use the term "document" to refer to the physical aspect
                    of the matter, while "text" or "work" refer precisely to the abstract aspect.
                    For the sake of this discussion, however, we stick to Renear and Wickett's
                    terminology.</para></footnote> And, considering the fact that a physical manifestation of a document may
            undergo change: How do we decide whether or not it is still a manifestation of the same
            document? </para><para>One way of accounting for the identity of documents through multiplicity and change
            among physical manifestations is to say that the document is an abstract object, and
            that its manifestations are instantiations of that abstract object. So what two physical
            objects must have in common in order to be manifestations of the same document is that
            they must both instantiate the same abstract object. <footnote><para>At this point we have already departed completely from Goodman, who had little
                    patience with any talk of abstract objects.</para></footnote>
        </para><para>In philosophy this kind of explanation by reference to abstract objects is perhaps
            contentious, but not uncommon. We observe that it is perhaps more common, and certainly
            regarded as less contentious, in domains outside philosophy. In the library professions
            and library and information science, for example, one of the currently important
            standards is Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records [<xref linkend="frbr"/>],
            distinguishes between bibliographic objects in terms of different abstraction levels
            such as item, manifestation, expression and work. </para></section><section xml:id="Triad"><title>The Inconsistent Triad </title><para>Renear and Wickett point out that the view that documents are abstract objects leads
            to the following inconsistent triad: <itemizedlist><listitem><para>Documents are strings.</para></listitem><listitem><para>Strings cannot be modified. </para></listitem><listitem><para>Documents can be modified.</para></listitem></itemizedlist>
        </para><para> The authors argue that all the three statements seem to have some initial
            plausibility, yet any two of them implies the negation of the remaining statement.</para><para>In the example as quoted, the explicit reference is to "strings", not to abstract
            objects. The authors make it very clear, however, not only that they regard strings as
            abstract objects, but also that they believe their argument to be valid irrespective of
            which particular kind of abstract object documents are thought to constitute. They take
            care to make explicit that the inconsistency cannot be seen to trade on any ambiguity in
            the way that the three statements are phrased. <footnote><para>In [<xref linkend="RenWick09"/>], they offer the following formalisation: <itemizedlist><listitem><para> (x)[(isaDocument(x) -&gt; isaString(x)] </para></listitem><listitem><para> (x)[(isaString(x) -&gt; ~isModifiable(x)] </para></listitem><listitem><para> (Ex)[(isaDocument(x) &amp; isModifiable(x)] </para></listitem></itemizedlist>
                </para></footnote> In [<xref linkend="RenWick10"/>] they observe that the inconsistency does
            not arise if the last of the three statements is read not as an existence claim, but
            only as a universal generalisation. </para><para>For purposes of terminology and generality, we may therefore reformulate the
            inconsistent triad as follows: <itemizedlist><listitem><para>1. All documents are abstract objects </para></listitem><listitem><para>2. No abstract object can change. </para></listitem><listitem><para>3. Documents exist, and they can change <footnote><para>Since this is a conjunction of two statements, the inconsistent
                                "triad" might actually be said to consist of four statements, rather
                                than three.</para></footnote> .</para></listitem></itemizedlist>
        </para></section><section xml:id="Responses"><title>Responses to the Inconsistency </title><para>It is not hard to agree with Renear and Wickett that the third of the three
            statements, that documents exist and that they can change, has "initial plausibility",
            as it seems to be implied in all our talk and all our dealings with documents as objects
            of our everyday world. The first statement may seem less obvious, but the authors argue
            forcefully, and in our eyes they are right, that it is an underlying assumption in much
            or most of the theoretical disciplines and technologies involved in document processing
            and management that documents are abstract objects. The second, i.e. the claim that
            abstract objects cannot change, is in accordance with the standard modern definition of
            abstract objects as non-spatial, atemporal and causally inefficient. <footnote><para>See for example [<xref linkend="rosen2012"/>] and [<xref linkend="swoyer2008"/>]. If everybody agrees that abstract objects cannot change and that documents
                    can change, it may seem futile to discuss whether documents are abstract
                    objects. However, it does not follow from these two claims alone that documents,
                    or our conceptions of them, do not presuppose or are not in some other sense
                    basically related to abstract objects. Moreover, the notions that abstract
                    objects are atemporal, non-spatial, and causally inefficient, and that documents
                    are in some sense abstract, are so deep-rooted in modern science and culture
                    that it seems reasonable to take the discussion seriously, futile or not.</para><para>Even so, to the authors of this paper (and probably to many of its readers) it
                    often seems awkward to use the term "object" (including "abstract object") about
                    abstract topics of scientific discourse, where we would often be inclined to
                    talk about concepts rather than objects. If we agree that a chair is an object
                    and freedom is a concept, for example, it seems more plausible to liken
                    documents, strings, and mathematical structures (say π) to freedom than to the
                    chair. The relation between concepts and objects as technical terms in this
                    context is a complex one, however, <!--[ref. to Frege "Concept and Object"]-->
                    and far too far-reaching for this paper. For purposes of the present discussion,
                    therefore, we try to keep with the "object" terminology, but the reader may
                    notice that we have sometimes, when this has seemed too strained, allowed
                    ourselves to use the term "concept". </para></footnote> We have nothing to say against the plausibility of the three statements at
            this stage, though we will come back to the point about abstract objects towards the
            end. </para><para>When the three statements form an inconsistent triad, and the inconsistency does not
            rest on some ambiguity, the natural question to ask is which of the statements to reject
            or modify. Renear and Wickett go through and argue against a considerable number of
            possible responses. Rejection of the statement that documents are abstract objects (in
            the form of "materialist" or "social object" strategies) as well as the rejection of the
            statement that documents can change (in the form of "new document" or "selection"
            strategies) are considered in <xref linkend="RenWick09"/>. Rejection of the statement
            that documents exist is considered in <xref linkend="RenWick10"/>. As a more acceptable
            alternative, they propose a "string-in-a-role" strategy, which partly denies the
            statement that documents can be modified and partly denies the statement that documents
            are abstract objects, by redefining the notion of a document. Although we do not think
            that all their arguments in favour of their own and against the other strategies are
            equally convincing <footnote><para>For example, some views are simply dismissed as "difficult to reconcile with a
                    naturalistic view of the world", without further argument.</para></footnote>, we will not pursue these matters here, but rather point to yet another
            alternative. </para></section><section xml:id="TAO"><title>Timed Abstract Objects </title><para>Science is not unfamiliar with the problems involved in describing time-related events
            and processes in physical reality in terms of time-independent mathematical concepts. A
            whole subfield of physics, dynamical systems, is devoted to the formal study of the
            mathematics of things that change. Poincaré (1854-1912) and Gibbs (1839-1903) provided
            the basic tools used today to study anything from the evolution of chemical reactions to
            the trajectories of celestial bodies. The basic approach of dynamical systems is to use
            functions of time to model the evolution of a point in a manifold. The set of points of
            the manifold represent all the potential states, the phase space, and each function
            draws a plot or a trajectory within the phase space. The evolution function is often
            defined as an iterative function that determines the state of the system in the future,
            given its conditions at the present. The study of the dynamical system is meant to
            determine the state of the system at any point in the future by solving the equations of
            the evolution function. </para><para> In computer science, the theory of automata studies the behavior of abstract machines
            that change their internal state upon receiving some input. More specifically, an
            automaton is an abstract machine that passes from a single initial state through several
            intermediate states to one of many final states (e.g., Success) depending on the input
            received. In this model, the automaton is a quintuple (Q, Ʃ, ∂, q0, F), where Q is the
            set of states (the state space) of the machine, Ʃ is the alphabet of the potential
            inputs, ∂ is a transition function from one state to another depending on elements of
            the alphabet Ʃ, q0 is the initial state, and F is the subset of Q that constitute the
            acceptable final states. An automaton succeeds on input X (a string of items of the
            alphabet Ʃ) if the machine transits from the initial state through intermediate states
            up to a final state while receiving input X, and fails if it remains in an intermediate
            state. </para><para>Automata are more useful than dynamic systems in our discussion: Dynamic systems
            analysis is well suited for modelling change in manifolds, i.e. continuous state spaces.
            Automata theory, however, is better suited to deal with discrete structures, such as
            strings. We may regard strings as the state space of the content of a document.</para><para>On this conception, strings are still immutable concepts that do not change over time.
            The number 2 is an immutable object. The string “To be or not to be” is also an
            immutable object. The set of all strings, past, future or potential, each one of them an
            immutable object, is also an immutable object. We could now proceed in two different,
            but ultimately equivalent, directions: On the one hand we could go the dynamical system
            way, introducing a change function for each document. This function is associated with
            the ordered independent variable similar to “time”, which we will call *time. <footnote><para>One may need to make further restrictive hypothesis about the *time points, if
                    he/she were inclined to over-analyze this theory, but for the moment we let it
                    stand that *time may not be time but behaves like time.</para></footnote> On the other hand, we could introduce an edit function, associated with an
            independent variable called “edit session”. In both cases, the function selects a
            specific string for each value of time t or edit session s. For instance, it will select
            string s1 for time t1, and string s2 for time t2, etc. Given a change function c or an
            edit function e, we can now define a document as the sequence of strings sc that are
            selected for each value in time or edit session. </para><para> Still, documents, like strings, are immutable concepts that do not change over time.
            But documents are not strings. While not changing in time, documents change in *time,
            because the function change associates different strings with different *time points. <!-- The rest of this para seems to create rather than avoid confusion 
                (see comments from third reviewer). Personally, I agree: "unchangable" does not normally mean 
                simply "not actually changed".  Nothing else (except perhaps a short remark further down, which 
                I also propose to delete) in the paper depends on this point, so I suggest leaving it out. -->
            <!--To avoid confusions, we
            will define a document as being unmodifiable or unchangeable if its sequence of strings
            is composed on only one string (i.e., if its change function always returns the same
            string regardless of the *time value), and as modifiable or changeable otherwise (i.e.,
            if its change function selects different strings at different *time points).-->
            This allows us to provide a time-dependent view of documents that is not affected by the
            immutableness of the basic mathematical concepts under it: we just select different
            strings at different *times and regard them as the state of the document at that *time.

            concepts. </para><para>Let us consider a physical book. We can identify some of its properties: weight, size,
            number of pages, color of the cover, quantity and shape of the ink on the 15th page, and
            so on. If we partake to a culture that recognizes the book as a cultural object, a
            *book, may be able to identify more properties: a title, an author, a publication date,
            a content, and so on. Now let us consider another book. We notice that it has the same
            physical properties as the first one (same weight, size, color, disposition of the ink
            in each page etc.) and, by interpreting the underlying *book, we notice it has the same
            title, author, content, etc. We need a concept to collect and describe these
            similarities against the fundamental difference that they are, in fact, numerically
            different objects. Thus we define each physical object as an Item of the same *book, and
            allow this *book to be perceivable as one through many different books, each having the
            same values for most cultural and physical properties, except for physical sameness. </para><para>Now let us consider a PDF file, which we are told is the source of the physical books
            seen before: it is physically completely different, being a computer structure rather

            same, and a number of culturally relevant related concepts (e.g., the author, the title,
            and so on) are identical. We have two different forms of book, but we interpret both
            forms as representing the same *book. We call them individual Manifestations of the same
            *book, and allow the *book to be perceivable as one through many different forms, each
            having the same values for a number of cultural properties, but many different physical
            properties. </para><para>Let us next consider another book, (either electronic or physical, it does not
            matter), which we are told is a different version of the same *book. This book is
            different from all the others, even in content: it may be a slight difference, a few
            words here and there, or a complete difference, as in having close to no similar content.<footnote><para>Consider for instance the translation of a Norwegian book into Italian, where
                    the two contents have practically no words in common.</para></footnote> Possibly, a number of cultural properties are the same: same author, same
            title (which does not mean the same string for the title property, but same conceptual
            value for the title concept), etc, and somehow we recognize that these two books are
            related, that they are one, in some more abstract way than by sharing the same content.
            We may have some properties that have the same values, but we may also have no sameness
            whatsoever, except only for some culturally shared and accepted, yet vague and
            approximate, sameness. We call the content of the two books, and the properties that are
            specific of each content, two Expressions of the same *book, and allow the *book to be
            perceivable as one through many different contents, each different in most or all
            properties except for some vague but culturally accepted sameness. </para><para>We call Work whatever is left, composed of any property we agree is still associated
            with the *book regardless of the Item, Manifestation and Expression it is perceivable
            through, or nothing but the above-mentioned indistinct sameness, if no property is left.
            The Work is characterized by those properties that are shared by all Expressions, and in
            turn all Manifestations and all Items of a *book. On the other hand, each of its
            Expressions and Manifestations exist in a multiplicity of instances. At different points
            of *time we may access the same *book and find different contents, different forms, even
            different physical properties (a corner is torn, a stain appears on the cover, the book
            is physically replaced by the bookstore due to a misprint, etc.). Thus Expressions,
            Manifestations and Items change in *time and are, by definition, changeable and
            modifiable. </para><para>The FRBR model has been used in different contexts: for the publishing domain [<xref linkend="peroni12"/>], in open-government contexts [<xref linkend="cifuentes11"/>],
            for the description of the musical publishing process [<xref linkend="raimond07"/>] and
            for the legal domain [<xref linkend="barabucci2009"/>]. For instance, Akoma Ntoso<footnote><para>
                    <link xlink:href="http://www.akomantoso.org" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="new" xlink:actuate="onRequest">http://www.akomantoso.org</link>
                </para></footnote> – a set of simple technology-neutral XML formats for parliamentary,
            legislative and judiciary documents – makes wide use of the FRBR hierarchy. It
            re-interprets parts of the FRBR endeavours so as to clearly and unambiguously identify
            the core attributes that characterise legislative documents. The entity Work is
            associated with the concept of identity, the Expression and Manifestation layers relate
            respectively to the content and the format of a such a document, and Item is used to
            indicate the particular location in which a concrete document is available. </para><para> In [<xref linkend="RenWick10"/>] the authors explain that although «[t]he word
            "document" has ... many senses», their own «informal characterization of the sense
            ...[is]... more or less the same sense implied in the XML specification, which defines
            "XML Document" as a string that matches certain formal constraints [<xref linkend="Bray08"/>]», and also that it «corresponds closely to the concept of an
            "expression" in the "Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records" (FRBR) [<xref linkend="frbr"/>]». </para><para>Yet on the one hand, the definition of XML documents seems more related to the
            Manifestation layer than to the Expression layer of FRBR: we read in <xref linkend="Bray08"/> that «an XML document may consist of one or many storage units.
            These are called entities; they all have content and are all (except for the document
            entity and the external DTD subset) identified by entity name». Thus, XML seems to be a
            vehicle to store document contents in a particular format by means of entities, which
            seems closer to the FRBR definition of Manifestation than that of Expression. </para><para>On the other hand, however, the association of XML documents with only one of the
            various abstraction layers of FRBR is in our eyes unfortunate, be it the Expression, the
            Manifestation or the Item layer. We believe that FRBR defines a specific endeavour to
            model the time-dependency of documents, i.e., the fact that the Work is associated in
            time with a number of different Expressions. It is only by allowing XML documents to be
            considered, depending on context, either as Items, as Manifestations, as Expressions or
            even as Works in their own right, that the full potential of applying FRBR also to
            electronic documents can be exploited. <footnote><para>At least one of the authors of <xref linkend="RenWick10"/> has discussed and
                    criticized both the FRBR hierarchy and its relation to XML in a number of
                    earlier publications, so perhaps their association of XML documents with FRBR
                    Expressions is just a simplification made for the sake of their argument.
                    However, their argument does seem to rely at least to some extent on this
                    simplification.</para></footnote>

                </para></footnote> provides an example of how changes to a document may be tracked. For
            instance, we may summarise the steps of the creation of a particular research paper
            (class fabio:ResearchPaper, a subclass of frbr:Work). Let us assume that this particular
            Work has three authors, as shown in the following excerpt (in Turtle syntax [<xref linkend="prudhommeaux11"/>]):
            <programlisting xml:space="preserve">           
                :paper a fabio:ResearchPaper
                ; frbr:creator :author1 , :author2, :author3 .
        </programlisting>
        </para><para> The very first (incomplete) draft content of this Work (i.e., an Expression) is
            written by one author only (let us suppose :author1). In FaBiO, this particular scenario
            can be described by referring to a particular realisation of the Work, an individual of
            fabio:ConferencePaper (i.e., a subclass of frbr:Expression), as follows:
            <programlisting xml:space="preserve">:paper frbr:realization :first-content-draft .
                :first-content-draft a fabio:ConferencePaper
                ; frbr:realizer :author1 .
                </programlisting>
        </para><para>In this way, we can record both that there are three authors of the paper and that
            :author1 was responsible for writing the first draft of that paper. Similarly, the
            writing process can proceed with :author2, who wrote, for instance, a revised version of
            the content written previously by :author1:
            <programlisting xml:space="preserve">:paper frbr:realization :revised-content-draft .
                :first-content-draft frbr:revision :revised-content-draft .
                :revised-content-draft a fabio:ConferencePaper
                ; frbr:realizer :author2 .
            </programlisting>
        </para><para>This process can be repeated until the authors produce the final version of the paper
            to be submitted to a venue. Has the document changed in time? If one considers each
            expression as a separate document (as suggested by Renear &amp; Wickett [Renear
            &amp; Wickett 2010]), then the answer is surely «no, none of the documents have
            changed». However, none of the previous documents record both author1, author2 and
            author3 as its authors . Thus, none of those documents fully represents the paper we are
            talking about, since it should record three people as its authors. </para><para>Everything changes if we take the Work :paper, rather then its various Expressions,
            into account. In this case, the author is clearly specified – i.e., all the people
            involved in the realisation of each Expression are authors of :paper. The Work in
            consideration has changed during *time, since it has been realised in several revised
            expressions that differ in content and in *time of creation. </para></section><section xml:id="Problems"><title>Problems with Timed Abstract Objects </title><para>We believe that this account of documents as Timed Abstract Objects has a number of
            strengths, and that it gives a coherent explanation of document change as well as our
            practices of identifying documents at different levels of abstraction. Notwithstanding
            its attractiveness, however, it also has some weak points. One of its consequences is
            that two documents which would perhaps on other accounts be regarded as identical would
            have to be regarded as different if they have different histories.<footnote><para>One may be reminded of Luis Borges' short story "Pierre Menard, Author of the
                    Quixote", where an (invented) XX century French writer re-writes word for word
                    Cervante's Don Quixote (a XVI century Spanish writer), not by copying it, nor by
                    imitating Cervantes, but by <emphasis role="ital">becoming</emphasis> a XX
                    century French writer that through his own conceptual and philosophical growth
                    generates the Quixote (in XVI century Spanish, of course). We guess that most
                    reader's intuitions do not provide a clear answer whether we are dealing with
                    one or two documents in such a case. On the Timed Abstract Object account,
                    however, the answer is clear enough: They are two different documents.</para></footnote> In other words, two series of identical changes to "the same" document at
            slightly different times will constitute two different documents. But perhaps this is
            just a minor quirk, perhaps we simply don't have clear intuitions in such cases. </para><para>However, the fact that its change history becomes so to speak a constitutive part of
            the document itself also implies that documents are not really accounted for as
            changeable objects, but as "events". Events, though they do take time, don't change.
            This attempt to account for document change has the seemingly paradoxical consequence
            that documents do not really change at all. (A poker may exemplify change by being first
            cold, and then warm. But a poker which is cold at the one end and warm at the other does
            not exemplify change.) <footnote><para>The example is taken from [<xref linkend="simons87"/>], p. 126.</para></footnote>
        </para><para> It is interesting, and may be instructive, to notice the parallel to the notion of
            space-time slices proposed by so-called "four-dimensionalism" in ontology, and some of
            the criticisms of that notion. The notion of space-time slices was introduced by
            philosophers like Quine and Goodman in an attempt to salvage the claim that concrete
            physical objects (or more generally, individuals) are identical with the sum of their
            parts (the claim that "the whole is nothing over and above its parts"), yet can undergo
            change. If an object is identical to the sum of its parts, then how can it lose a part,
            and yet remain the same object? One favoured example in the discussion is a cat losing
            its tail. After the loss of its tail, the cat is still the same cat, but clearly not the
            same sum of parts.</para><para> The answer proposed by four-dimensionalism is that the cat, correctly considered, is
            not the sum of its parts at any single moment, but the sum of all its temporal as well
            as its spatial parts. And when the cat is considered as the sum of all its
            spatio-temporal parts, there is no difficulty explaining how references to the cat
            before and after the loss of its tail can be references to the same cat: they refer to
            two spatio-temporal parts of the very same cat. What we have before us at any particular
            moment when we consider the cat is not the whole cat, but a temporal part, a time-slice,
            of the cat.</para><para> One of the critics of this conception, Peter Simons, points out that on the
            four-dimensional account, the cat losing its tail does not really <emphasis role="ital">change</emphasis>: The loss of its tail is so to speak baked into the cat as such.
            Simons' complaint "is not that the four-dimensional ontology is inconsistent (if it is
            inconsistent, this is far from obvious), but that no one has begun to do the work
            required to make it understandable to we users of a continuant/occurent ontology". <footnote><para>[<xref linkend="simons87"/>], p. 123. The "continuant/occurent" distinction is
                    (roughly) a distinction between things, substances or individuals on the one
                    hand, and events, processes etc. on the other. Simons contends that adherents of
                    four-dimensionalism are "cheating", i.e. they are relying on the ordinary
                    distinction between continuants and occurents in all their claims that the
                    former can be reduced to the latter. He does not argue that a language where all
                    references to continuants were consistently translated to references to
                    four-dimensional objects and their spatio-temporal parts is impossible, but that
                    it is hard to see how it would be comprehensible, and that no one has even begun
                    the task of constructing such a language. </para></footnote>
        </para><para>It may be conceded that a proposal to consider documents as Timed Abstract Objects is
            not quite as drastic as the analogous attempt to account for continuants in general as
            four-dimensional objects. But, as suggested above, we do think that the proposal has
            similar, counter-intuitive implications. Finally, the account may have counter-intuitive
            consequences when applied to the actual handling of documents in every-day contexts,
            especially involving digital documents. When deciding whether two document files
            instantiate the same document we do not normally, and would normally not be in the
            position to, decide whether or not they have been brought about by the same
            string-modifying operations at the same points of time, nor is it easy to think of
            examples where such information would be considered relevant. <footnote><para>It may of course be argued that this is only because such information is in
                    fact rarely available.</para></footnote>
        </para><para>More importantly, however, we believe that the difficulties with this and the other
            proposals to deal with the inconsistent triad may be rooted in the concept of abstract
            object presupposed by all of them. Renear and Wickett explicitly exclude from
            consideration "responses that deny the second assertion", i.e. (in our rephrasing) that
            abstract objects cannot change. </para><para> We have come to believe that as long as abstract objects are defined as atemporal,
            non-spatial and causally ineffective, none of the above accounts can explain the perhaps
            most important distinctive feature of documents: That they can carry information, be
            written and read by human beings, and thus serve the transmission of knowledge, culture
            and value.</para><para>Admittedly, Renear and Wickett's proposal is not that documents themselves are
            abstract objects, but that they are abstract objects in a particular role. Similarly, on
            the Timed Abstract Object account the claim is not that documents themselves are
            abstract objects, but that they are functions from time sequences to abstract objects.
            On both accounts, however, documents are defined in relation to abstract objects. <footnote><para>It may be objected that a function is not an object, but a relation. This may
                    be true, but is hardly relevant for the argument presented here.</para></footnote>
        </para><para>The problem of explaining how we can have epistemic access to abstract objects is well
            known. For example, Swoyer, a realist about abstract objects, says:<footnote><para> [<xref linkend="swoyer2008"/>], p. 27. See also [<xref linkend="rosen2012"/>]
                    and [<xref linkend="dorr2008"/>]) </para></footnote>
            <blockquote><para>Epistemology is the Achilles' heel of realism about abstracta. We are
                    biological organisms thoroughly ensconced in the natural, spatio-temporal causal
                    order. Abstract entities, by contrast are atemporal, non-spatial, and causally
                    inert, so they cannot affect our senses, our brains, or our instruments for
                    measuring and detecting.</para></blockquote> It may very well be that atemporal, non-spatial and causally ineffective
            abstract objects exist. Perhaps mathematical objects like numbers or sets are of this
            kind (even though similar problems concerning epistemic access apply here). But we seem
            forced to conclude not only that documents are not themselves abstract objects, but also
            that any account of documents that relies on our epistemic access to abstract objects
            remains unsatisfactory unless the definition of abstract objects on which it relies
            differs from the standard one. </para></section><section xml:id="Conclusion"><title>Conclusion </title><para>Among the considered accounts of documents in terms of abstract objects, we believe
            that the Timed Abstract Object account is the best. However, the failure of all accounts
            of documents in terms of abstract objects to explain how we can have epistemic access to
            them is a major drawback. The fact remains that documents exist, that they are created
            and can be changed by human beings, and that they can go out of existence. We remain
            agnostic about their ontological status, but we conclude that either documents are not
            abstract objects after all, or they are abstract objects of a kind which does not
            correspond to the standard definition of what an abstract object is.</para></section><bibliography><title>References</title><bibliomixed xml:id="barabucci2009" xreflabel="Barabucci et al. 2009"> Barabucci, G.,
