      and which was presented briefly at the LREC 2012 Workshop on Collaborative Resource
      Development and Delivery. Initial point was the development of an easy to use information
      system for the description of standards developed in ISO/IEC TC37/SC4 <emphasis>Language
        Resources Management</emphasis>. Since these standards are heavily related to each other it
      is usually not feasible to adopt only a single standard for one's work but to dive into the
      standards jungle in full. Because of positive feedback after the presentation of the prototype
      at the Istanbul Workshop we decided to broaden the information accessible by the system to
      markup language related standards.</para></section><section><title>The problem with standards</title><para>Every year at Balisage's markup game or quiz difficult questions regarding markup have to
      be answered. Even the participants of this very special conference have sometimes problems to
      find the correct answer. An some of the younger generation have never heard terms like
      'sosofo' or 'DSSSL' before. At current, an unmanageable number of standards is available for
      annotating data of various kinds. These standards can be divided into several groups,
      according to such different features such as standard body (W3C, ISO, OASIS, HL7, to name just
      a few), basic or derivative work (i. e., standards that are built upon basic specifications),
      the state (de jure vs. de facto standard), or the topic. <xref linkend="fig1"/> gives a very
      rough overview about some of the named aspects. Other divisions would deal with a temporal
      aspect of standardization: specifications change over the time of development, some (almost)
      historical standards have been abandoned and have been replaced by other
      specifications.</para><figure xml:id="fig1"><title>A rough overview about the complexity in the fields of standardization.</title><mediaobject><imageobject><imagedata fileref="../../../vol8/graphics/Stuhrenberg01/Stuhrenberg01-001.png" format="png"/></imageobject></mediaobject></figure><para>Missing in the aforementioned list is another interesting aspect: the relationships
      between different standards. For example, meta languages such as SGML or XML are used to
      define (that is, syntax and possibly a schema formalism) markup languages. A given markup
      language is defined by a schema which in turn is defined by using a schema language (either a
      grammar-based or rule-based constraint language), and so on. Apart from these relations
      between basic standards and those that are built upon these, are other relations between
      members of the first group and of the second group. Some of the formal restrictions of XML
      instances and XML DTDs (and even XSD) are based on faits accomplis created during the
      development of SGML, DSSSL and HyTime &amp;#8211; standards that are decades old. Features
      that were already present in DSSSL, have been improved and adapted for current W3C standards
      such as XPath, XSLT and XSL-FO. XPath is usually used via a host language such as XSLT. The
      Corpus Encoding Standard (CES) is an application of the SGML-based version of the TEI, P3. The
      are dozens of similar relations, some are only good for get bonus points at Balisage Bingo but
      others really help in understanding specific issues one may have when working with a given
      specification. At least the knowledge about these older standards and the decisions that were
      made during their design process and which still impact current technologies such as XML
      schema or XSLT runs the risk of being forgotten just because of the amount of time already
      passed.</para><para>This holds especially when dealing with non-basic standards, for example with markup
      languages for annotating linguistic data. During the last couple of years a large number of
      specifications have been developed in ISO/IEC TC 37/SC 4 Language Resources Management. These
      standards are often released to the public during their various stages of the standardization
      process (either as publicly available specialisations, such as Draft International Standard or
      as topic of a research paper). However, these version may substantially differ from the final
      version of the standard which is usually not available without charge. In addition, the
      relations between these specifications are numerous which complicates their correct
      use.</para><para>Another problem is the fact, that often scholars and researchers are not even aware that
      standardized formats and models exist.</para></section><section><title>Providing guidance</title><para>We propose a community project to build up a platform providing guidance through the
      jungle that has been grown around the XML world. Starting with a very small set of standards
      and specifications and constructed as an XRX (XForms, Rest, XQuery) application we offer the
      starting point for a platform that allows Balisage's experts to share their knowledge with
      others. During the last months we have developed a prototypical web-based information system
      that serves as a starting point in providing guidance through the standards jungle as part of
      the <emphasis>CLARIN</emphasis> distributed project group.<footnote><para>The system was presented in May 2012 at the LREC 2012 Workshop on Collaborative
          Resource Development and Delivery and is described in more detail in <xref linkend="Stuehrenberg2012"/>.</para></footnote> Up to now, it contains a collection of topics such as <emphasis>Meta
        Language</emphasis>, <emphasis>Metadata</emphasis>, <emphasis>Generic Corpus
        Annotation</emphasis>, or <emphasis>Constraint Language</emphasis>, amongst others, standard
      bodies such as <emphasis>ISO</emphasis>, <emphasis>W3C</emphasis>, <emphasis>OASIS</emphasis>,
      and <emphasis>HL7</emphasis>, and 25 specifications at the time of writing. <xref linkend="fig2"/> shows a partial screenshot of the current state. Relations between
      specifications (in this case between TEI P3 and SGML and P3 and CES) are described both in a
      textual and graphical way.</para><figure xml:id="fig2"><title>A screenshot of the current state of the information system (showing TEI's

We have developed a
        lightweight format for structuring information about specifications, topics, and standard
        setting bodies defined by an XSD. Although it seems to be at least questionable to invent
        yet another annotation format especially for this kind of project we tried to stick as close
        to existing annotation formats such as the TEI as possible while streamlining the format and
        therefore keeping it small and simple. <xref linkend="lst.format"/> shows an excerpt of the
        storage format.</para><figure xml:id="lst.format"><title>An excerpt of the storage format</title><programlisting xml:space="preserve">

        Source eXist database as starting point but try to do not use any application-dependant
        features). Queries on the data are performed via XQuery scripts and forms will be
        implemented by XForms (which in turn will be processed by XSLTForms supported by eXist). The
        goal of the information system is not to replicate information that is already available
        (but may not be traceable anymore), but to connect pieces of information and enrich these
        pieces with small amounts of additional data. In the example above (<xref linkend="lst.format"/>) we only refer to the information available at the W3C (and
        respective places). Information about standard bodies and topics is stored in a similar
        way.</para></section><section><title>Representation</title><para>The output of the information system is based on HTML5's XML syntax. Although the
        textual representation is feasible for providing detailed information about a given
        standard, our plan is to establish an additional graphical representation format. This
        second representation should provide a better overview of the relations between a large
        number of standards at once. Minor demonstrations have been done with D3 <xref linkend="Bostock2011"/>, an Open Source JavaScript library that directly manipulates
        objects in the DOM tree to interactively visualize data<footnote><para>Additional information and downloads are available at <link xlink:href="http://d3js.org/" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="new" xlink:actuate="onRequest">http://d3js.org/</link>.</para></footnote>. However, since JavaScript and XQuery share some syntax elements (e.g. the curly
        brackets) there are some minor traps to avoid. In the current prototype we therefore only
        use the non-interactive SVG graphics that are included in the standard's description page
        (see <xref linkend="fig2"/>). Since browser support for interactive 2- and 3-dimensional
        graphics is getting stronger and stronger, other options such as WebGL-based representations
        are possible as well (see <xref linkend="Jettka2011"/> for example).</para></section><section><title>Current state and future work</title><para>The current state of the information system is still quite rough. What we want to
        propose is allow Balisage's participants to get involved in the process of collecting and
        sharing information about the standards they work with and have knowledge of. In addition,
        Balisage is the place to find experts in SVG (which is used to display relations between two
        or more specialisations), XQuery and XForms. If we manage to bring these people together to
        establish a community that is willing to share its knowledge the final product could be of
        much use to scholars and researchers around the world. As a first starting point we will
        publish the XML schema defining the annotation format to receive comments and add further
        enhancements. After a stable format has been established, interesting parties could create
        specification sheets and upload them into the platform. In addition, we will open the
        platform for reading access for other people to give feedback on a less technical way. The
        current prototype is made available at <link xlink:href="http://clarin.ids-mannheim.de/standards/index.xq" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="new" xlink:actuate="onRequest">http://clarin.ids-mannheim.de/standards/index.xq</link>.</para></section></section><bibliography><title>References</title><bibliomixed xml:id="Bostock2011" xreflabel="Bostock et al., 2011">Michael Bostock, Vadim
