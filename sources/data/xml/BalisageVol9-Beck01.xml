        sciences journal literature. On average the PMC team processes 14,000 articles per month.
        All of the articles are submitted to the archive by publishers in an agreed-upon markup
        format, and the articles are transformed to a common article model. To help reduce the
        number of content- or markup-related problems encountered, PMC puts new participating
        journals through an evaluation period that includes both automated and manual checks. </para><para>Once a journal has passed the evaluation stage, it sends its content to PMC on a regular
        production schedule. The production content is processed automatically when it arrives, with
        any processing problems generating expected error messages. Although most of the content
        sent to PMC has been through production systems and QA when it was published, we've found
        that there is still a level of manual content checking that needs to be done on the
        production content. Any problems found must be investigated to determine if they result from
        a problem in the source content, a problem with the PMC ingest transforms, or simply a
        problem with our rendering of the normalized XML content. </para><para>Having the content in XML certainly has advantages: it can be validated against a schema
        and easily manipulated and processed, but XML doesn't solve all of the problems. A sharp eye
        and attention to detail are still needed by the production team as they would be for any
        publishing process. </para></abstract><author><personname><firstname>Christopher</firstname><surname>Kelly</surname></personname><personblurb><para/></personblurb><affiliation><jobtitle>PMC Production Team Lead</jobtitle><orgname>National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), National Library of Medicine

    of Health's free digital archive of full-text biomedical and life sciences journal literature.
    Content is stored in XML at the article level. and is displayed dynamically from the archival
    XML each time that a user retrieves an article. </para><para>PubMed Central was started in 1999 to allow free full-text access to journal articles.
    Participation by journals is voluntary. From the beginning there has always been a requirement
    that participating journals provide their content to NCBI marked up in some "reasonable" SGML or
    XML format <citation linkend="Beck01">[Beck01]</citation> along with the highest-resolution
    images available, PDF files (if available), and all supplementary material. Complete details on
    the PMC's file requirements are available <citation linkend="PMC02">[PMC02]</citation>.</para><section><title>The Promise of Marked-up Content</title><para>Building a full-text journal article repository seemed like a pretty straightforward task
      in when PMC was conceived in 2000. After all, participating journals already had their content
      in SGML or XML that they were putting online or sending to a vendor to be put online. All we
      would need to do would be to get the marked-up content, render it in PMC, and store it. </para><para>But we soon found out that the content we were receiving was not of the same quality as
      the articles that had been printed or even as the articles showing on the journals' websites.
      This seemed odd; the SGML was created for the online product, and this SGML was delivered to
      PMC for the archive. At the turn of the century, XML-first publishing workflows (where the
      articles are authored in XML or converted to XML as soon as they were submitted to a journal
      and then processed as XML) were not the norm. </para><para>The workflow that we encountered generally went something like this: <orderedlist><listitem><para>article is written, submitted, peer reviewed, revised, and accepted as a Word
            document (or more specifically, a printout of a Word document).</para></listitem><listitem><para>accepted article copyedited in the Word file (to capture the author's
            keystrokes).</para></listitem><listitem><para>copyedited Word file is ingested into a typesetting system and made into
            pages.</para></listitem><listitem><para>any changes in the author proof cycle are made in the typesetting system under the
            direction of copyeditors or proofreaders. </para></listitem><listitem><para>typesetting files are built into issues, checked by copyeditors or proofreaders and
            sent for printing. </para></listitem><listitem><para>typesetting files are then converted to SGML/XML - generally to a model defined by
            the online service.</para></listitem><listitem><para>SGML/XML files are converted to HTML, and the HTML is checked for errors.</para></listitem><listitem><para>HTML is corrected so that the online article represents the printed article.</para></listitem><listitem><para>SGML/XML files are stored away - never to be thought of again.</para></listitem></orderedlist></para><para>Things were going pretty well in that workflow up through item 5. The author's keystrokes
      had been used from the original word processing files&amp;#x2014;reducing errors that would
      have been introduced by rekeying the article; a person familiar with the content (usually at
      least two of a copyeditor, proofreader, or author) checked the files and any changes at each
      stage until it was sent off to press. </para><para>At this point it is out of the hands of the content folks and into the hands of the data
      converters. In step 6, the typesetting files used as the source for the transformation
      contained some information about the structure of the article, but it certainly was not enough
      to build a proper SGML/XML representation of the article. Assumptions are made during the
      transformation, and a surprising amount of hand tagging - copy and paste - was done to create
      the files. The problem areas are not surprising: metadata, tables, and math.</para><para>From the PMC point of view, the real tragedy in this (generalized and non-specific)
      workflow happens at step 8, when the files are reviewed by a proofreader but corrections are
      made to the output HTML files and not back in the source SGML files. Once we started
      processing those SGML files in the young PMC system, we took a close look at the output of our
      rendering of the files to identify any problems with the way our system was handling the
      files. </para><para>We started to find a good number of problems with the supplied SGML that were not in the
      HTML version available on the web - and a surprising number that were incorrect on the web.
      Unfortunately we did not count the errors that we encountered at this point. We simply fixed
      them, reported them to the publisher so that any that also appeared on their site could be
      fixed, and moved on the the next article or issue. This is when we knew we would have to have
      a team of content specialists checking all of the content we get in PMC.</para></section><section><title>PMC Ingest Workflow</title><para>The PMC processing model has been addressed in detail previously <citation linkend="Beck01">[Beck01]</citation>. Briefly it is diagrammed in <xref linkend="F1"/>. For
      each article, we receive a set of files that includes the text in SGML or XML, the highest
      resolution figures available, a PDF file if one has been created for the article, and any
      supplementary material or supporting data. The text is converted to the current version of the
      NISO Archiving and Interchange Tag Set <citation linkend="JATS01">[JATS01]</citation>, and the
      images are converted to a web-friendly format. The source SGML or XML, original images,
      supplementary data files, PDFs, and NLM XML files are stored in the archive. Articles are
      rendered online using the NLM XML, PDFs, supplementary data files, and the web-friendly
      images. <figure xml:id="F1" xreflabel="Fig. 1"><title>PMC Processing Model</title><mediaobject><imageobject><imagedata format="png" fileref="../../../vol9/graphics/Beck01/Beck01-001.png"/></imageobject></mediaobject></figure></para><para>For purposes of this paper, we will concentrate on the text processing.</para></section><section><title>PMC Philosophy of Text Processing</title><para>There are four main principals to the PMC philosophy of text processing</para><para>First, we expect to receive marked-up versions of an article that are well-formed, valid,
      and accurately represents the article as it was published. We do not go so far as requiring
      that the content be true or correct as Syd Bauman illustrates <citation linkend="Bauman01">[Bauman01]</citation>, merely that the article represents the version of record.</para><para>The question of what is the "Version of Record" is left up to the publisher. It may be a
      printed copy, a PDF version, or the journal's website. </para><para>Unlike the early days of PMC as described above, we do not correct articles or files. That
      is, we will not fix something that is wrong in the version of record nor will we make a
      correction to an XML file. All problems found in either processing or QA of files are reported
      back to the publisher to be corrected and resubmitted. </para><para>Thirdly, the goal of PMC is to represent the content of the article and not the formatting
      of the printed page, the PDF, or the journal's website. </para><para>And finally, we must run a Quality Assessment on content coming into PMC to ensure that
      the content in PMC accurately reflects the article as it was published. Our QA is a
      combination of automated checks and manual checking of articles. To help ensure that the
      content we are spending time ingesting to PMC is likely to be worthwhile, journals must pass
      through an evaluation process before they can send content to PMC in a regular production
      workflow.</para></section><section><title>The Data Evaluation Process</title><para>The data evaluation process has been described previously <citation linkend="Beck01">[Beck01]</citation>, but it is integral in ensuring the quality of content that is being
      submitted to PMC.</para><para>Journals joining PMC must pass two tests. First, the journal must pass PMC's scientific
      quality standard, which means that the journal must be approved for the NLM collection by
      NLM's Selection and Acquisitions section <citation linkend="NLM01">[NLM01]</citation>. This
      check ensures that the journal's content is "in scope" for a medical library and is of
      sufficient scientific quality for the archive.</para><para>Next the journal must go through a technical evaluation to "be sure that the journal can
      routinely supply files of sufficient quality to generate complete and accurate articles online
      without the need for human action to correct errors or omissions in the data." <citation linkend="PMC03">[PMC03]</citation></para><para>For the data evaluation, a journal supplies a set of sample files for approximately 50
      articles. These files are put through a series of automated and human checks to ensure that
      the XML is valid, accurately reflects the publication model of the journal (publication dates,
      for example) and is a complete and accurate representation of the published articled. There is
      a baseline set of "Minimum Data Requirements" that must be met before the evaluation proceeds
      to the more human-intense content accuracy checking <citation linkend="PMC04">[PMC04]</citation>. These minimum criteria are listed briefly below:<orderedlist><listitem><para>Each sample package must be complete: all required data files (XML/SGML, PDF if
            available, image files, supplementary data files) for every article in the package must
            be present and named correctly.</para></listitem><listitem><para>All XML files must conform to an acceptable journal article DTD.</para></listitem><listitem><para>All XML/SGML files must parse according to their DTD.</para></listitem><listitem><para>Regardless of the XML/SGML DTD used, the following metadata information must be
            present and tagged with correct values in every sample file: <itemizedlist><listitem><para>Journal ISSN or other unique Journal ID</para></listitem><listitem><para>Journal Publisher</para></listitem><listitem><para>Copyright statement (if applicable)</para></listitem><listitem><para>License statement (if applicable)</para></listitem><listitem><para>Volume number</para></listitem><listitem><para>Issue number (if applicable)</para></listitem><listitem><para>Pagination/article sequence number</para></listitem><listitem><para>Issue-based or Article-based publication dates. Articles submitted to PMC must
                  contain publication dates that accurately reflect the journal’s publication
                  model.</para></listitem></itemizedlist></para></listitem><listitem><para>All image files for figures must be legible, and submitted in high-resolution TIFF
            or EPS format, according to the PMC Image File Requirements.</para></listitem></orderedlist></para><para>These seem like simple and obvious things - xml files must be valid - but the minimum data
      requirements have greatly reduced the amount of rework that the PMC Data Evaluation group has
      to do. Certainly it helps to be explicit about even the most obvious of things.</para><para>During the data evaluation, PMC reviews 100% of the sample articles by eye.</para></section><section><title>Production QA</title><para>The PMC production team is made up of a set of Journal Managers who are responsible for
      the processing and checking of content for the journal titles that are assigned to them. We
      use a combination of automated processing checks and manual checking of articles to help
      ensure the accuracy of the content in PMC. </para><para>We can leverage the fact that all content is sent to us in SGML or XML to eliminate any
      article files that are not well-formed (if XML) or valid to the model they claim to be valid
      against. 100% of not-well-formed or invalid files are returned to the provider to be corrected
      and resubmitted.</para><para>The PMC Style Checker (<citation linkend="Beck01">[Beck01]</citation>) is used during the ingest process to ensure that all content flowing
      into PMC is in the PMC common XML format for loading to the database. The errors provided by
      the Style Checker provides us with a level of automated checking on the content itself that
      can highlight problems, but it only goes so far. For example, the Style Checker can tell you
      if an electronic publication date is tagged completely to PMC Style (contains values in year,
      month, and day elements) in a file, but it can't tell you if the values themselves are correct
      and actually represent the electronic publication date of the article. </para><para>PMC also has a series of automated data integrity checks that run once content is loaded
      to the database which can identify, among other things,  problems like duplicate articles
      submitted to the system, and potential discrepancies in issue publication dates for a group of
      articles in the same issue.</para><para>Early in the PMC project the questions of "what and how much to check?" were left to the
      discretion of the Journal Manager. But we soon found out that certain things had to be checked
      more frequently. All articles with marked-up math (in MathML or LateX) get a close review
      because the quality of marked up math has been one of the problem areas since the beginning of
      the project. In addition, all published corrections and retractions needed to be checked
      closely to ensure that the tagging provided in the source XML allows PMC to build a link
      between the correction/retrction and the article being corrected/retracted. We also check the
      ever PDF that we generate for manuscripts being tagged for the NIH Public Access Project
        <citation linkend="NIH01">[NIH01]</citation>.</para><para>As the project began to grow, both in terms of the amount of content coming into PMC and
      the number of Journal Managers required to manage the content, it became obvious that we
      needed to quantify the QA process. First, the production team compiled a "Content QA
      checklist" which was a collection of some of the most common (and serious) errors encountered
      over the years. Next, we built a system that shows each Journal Manager the journals that are
      assigned to him, and which articles need to be checked <xref linkend="F2"/>. The system
      selects a percentage of articles from each "batch" of new content deposited by the journal as
      they are processed and loaded to the PMC database. The number of articles in each batch is
      determined by the publication model and participation mode of the journal itself. Traditional
      journals which deposit a whole issue at a time into PMC will normally have a "batch"
      consisting of all the articles in the issue. Journals which publishing on a continuous basis
      and send content to PMC article-by-article will have batches which reflect how much content is
      deposited during a given day.</para><para>While it would be nice to be able to check 100% of the articles being loaded into the PMC
      database, this is generally not reasonable because of resources. So, once an journal has
      passed the tightly monitored data evaluation period, and has demonstrated over a period of
      time after moving into production that it can provide generally error-free data, QA is done on
      more of a spot check basis. By default, new journals that come out of data evaluation and move
      into production are set with a higher threshold of articles selected for QA in the system.
      Once PMC's Journal Manager is confident in the journal's ability to provide good, clean, data,
      the article-selection percentages are lowered over time. Journals with a proven track record
      of providing error-free data into PMC generally have lower percentage of articles checked for
      QA. If the Journal Manager begins to see problems on an ongoing basis, the percentage of
      articles checked may be increased.<figure xml:id="F2" xreflabel="Fig. 2"><title>QA System Dashboard</title><mediaobject><imageobject><imagedata format="jpg" fileref="../../../vol9/graphics/Beck01/Beck01-002.jpg"/></imageobject></mediaobject></figure></para><para>The system includes the original list of standard errors that was compiled as the first
      "Content QA checklist"; this list has grown the years as new errors are encountered. PMC
      Article Errors are grouped into eight major categories: Article Information, Article Body,
      Back Matter, Figures and Tables, Special Characters and Math, Generic Errors, Image Quality,
      and PDF Quality. Within each of these major categories, there may be one or more
      sub-categories. For example, in the "Article Body" section there is a subcategory for
      "Sections and Subsections", containing errors for mising sections, or sections that have been
      nested incorrectly in the flow of the body text. In <xref linkend="F3"/> the errors specific
      to Article Information are shown in the purple box. If a Journal Manager finds that the
      "Publication date is missing or does not match the version of record", then he or she simply
      checks that box and that error is recorded for that article. Of course, there is always a text
      box available to allow a Journal Manger to enter an unforeseen error.<figure xml:id="F3" xreflabel="Fig. 3"><title>Article Errors List</title><mediaobject><imageobject><imagedata format="jpg" fileref="../../../vol9/graphics/Beck01/Beck01-003.jpg"/></imageobject></mediaobject></figure></para><para> Processing can be done either on the issue level or on a group of articles that arrives
      at PMC in a given time period. Each error is classified as "severe" or "normal" and as a "PMC
      Error" or a "Data Error". See the purple box in <xref linkend="F4"/> for an example of a
      totaled batch of articles. <figure xml:id="F4" xreflabel="Fig. 4"><title>Error Totals</title><mediaobject><imageobject><imagedata format="jpg" fileref="../../../vol9/graphics/Beck01/Beck01-004.jpg"/></imageobject></mediaobject></figure></para><para>At any time, the Journal Manager can review the accumulated errors for a batch as seen in
        <xref linkend="F5"/>. This report can be output in RTF format so it can be sent to the
      publisher as a Word file (<xref linkend="F6"/>&gt;). <figure xml:id="F5" xreflabel="Fig. 5"><title>Batch Errors</title><mediaobject><imageobject><imagedata format="jpg" fileref="../../../vol9/graphics/Beck01/Beck01-005.jpg"/></imageobject></mediaobject></figure>

      work that is being done for the PMC project, but we find that even this long after the 10-year
