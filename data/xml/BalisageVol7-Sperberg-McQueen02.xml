  learn new things.  And as Tommie Usdin reminded us in the opening
  session [<xref linkend="Usdin"/>], confrontation with other people
  and listening to things other people have done, including (or even
  especially including) things we don’t expect in advance to
  find especially interesting, can open our minds to new possibilities.
  And opening new possibilities is, in a way, how many of us presumably
    got here.<footnote><para>This is a lightly revised transcription of my remarks at
	the closing of Balisage 2011; I have corrected a few errors,
	broken up a few leggy sentences, and deleted some side
	remarks, but otherwise left things as they are, even where the
	line of discussion could use a thorough reorganization.  I am
	grateful to Tonya Gaylord of Mulberry Technologies for
	preparing the transcript.</para></footnote>
  </para><para>One reason to get interested in a new technology or a new
  programming language or a new markup language or a new kind of
  document language is that it opens up possibilities that you
  didn’t have before.  By looking at SGML and thinking about what
  SGML gave us, those of us who got interested in descriptive markup
  in the form of SGML learned about ways in which WordPerfect or
  WordStar or Waterloo Script or troff had been closing down
  possibilities for us — possibilities we hadn’t missed
  because we hadn’t thought about them, because the tool shapes the
  hand that wields it and the intellectual tool shapes the mind that
  uses it.  If your document description language is focused, as so
  many of them were and are, on putting ink on paper, then you’re
  going to think that document description and information management
  is about fonts and layout.  And it’s only when you get a language
  that says, “No, documents are about more than that.” (a
  language that ironically received much of its original impetus from
  typesetters, who know perfectly well that fonts can change in
  different renderings of the same document) — it’s only when
  you see that that you begin to think about other possibilities.  
  </para><para>And that opening up of possibilities can easily give you the
    sense that you are seeing the dawn of a new day.</para><para>That’s why some of us at least got interested in
    descriptive markup as opposed to WYSIWYG.  (As Brian Kernighan is
    quoted as saying, “The problem with ‘what you see is
    what you get’ is that what you see is all you get.”
    And when that’s all you’ve ever gotten, you may not miss the
    things that it doesn’t give you.)  That’s one of the reasons
    that other people got interested in XML as opposed to straight
    HTML. That’s one reason people get interested in multiple
    languages instead of a single language or, generalizing, in
    a metalanguage as opposed to an object language.</para><para>New technologies can open new possibilities.  So new specs
    defining new technologies are always interesting. In this context
    recall the papers we got from Cornelia Davis about the systematic
    application of new specs in the XML space (and some old specs in
    the XML space!) to make new things possible [<xref linkend="Davis"/>], or Eric Freese’s report on EPUB3 [<xref linkend="Freese"/>], or Piotr Bański’s application of
    the TEI ODD system to the ISO Linguistic Markup Framework [<xref linkend="Banski"/>].  All of these are showing us ways of opening
    up new possibilities.</para><para>Sometimes new views on existing specs can open up some
    surprising perspectives, as we found on Tuesday, when
    Hans-Jürgen Rennau reported on the work that he and David Lee
    had done on XDML [<xref linkend="Rennau"/>].  And sometimes we get
    new perspectives, new possibilities, from the collision of
    existing specs: think of Kurt Cagle talking about the collsion of
    XQuery and SparQL [<xref linkend="Cagle"/>].  In the other track
    about the same time, Julien Seinturier had some very interesting
    remarks about the different way that domain specialists — in
    his case, linguists — react to XQuery and SparQL [<xref linkend="Seinturier"/>] that made me think about ways it might
    make sense to change what I teach when I teach XQuery.</para><para>Sometimes the collision with other specs leads us to seek
    better ways of co-existence.  You know, sometimes you’d really
    like to conquer the world and get the other spec out of the way.
    (SGML did manage to displace ODA; that was a long hard struggle,
    but I haven’t heard anybody but SGML people mention ODA for a
    long, long time.)  But in the short term, XML is going to co-exist
    with JSON for quite a while, so I’m glad to see David Lee
    looking for a way to get back-and-forth without information loss
    and with at least reasonably plausible translation results so the
    product of the transformation doesn’t always sound like the
    output of a badly trained machine translation program [<xref linkend="Lee"/>].  Even within the XML community, XQuery and
    XSLT are going to co-exist for a while, so Evan Lenz’s ideas
    for hybridizing them may give us new perspectives for the future
    [<xref linkend="Lenz"/>].</para><para>People talk about turning over a new leaf.  It took me a long
    time to understand that idiom.  Eventually, I concluded that in
    its original sense it refers to a school boy who has spoiled one
    page by spilling too much ink turning over a new page, and now
    it’s a fresh new opening.  There’s nothing wrong with this
    new leaf; it’s full of possibility.  The French poet,
    Stéphane Mallarmé, talks about this.  He talks about
    the empty page whose blankness defends it.<footnote><para><quote>le vide papier que la blancheur
          défend</quote>; the words are from the poem
        <emphasis>Brise marine</emphasis> (<emphasis>Sea
          breeze</emphasis>), which is reprinted ubiquitously  [<xref linkend="Mallarme"/>]; there are also numerous copies on the
        Web.
      </para></footnote> Why does the blankness <quote>defend</quote> the page?
    Because the page is currently full of possibilities, and as soon
    as I write a word on it, I’ve spoiled an infinite number of
    them.  This thought can lead to paralysis, of course.</para><para>Sometimes those of us who are predicting the dawn of a new day
    will also assume or predict that everyone is going to see the
    beauty of these possibilites, rejoice in them, and adopt this new
    technology.  And sometimes the rosy possibilities that we foresee
    will accrue only if everybody does adopt the new technology. Some
    of you will be thinking, along about now, about all of the
    rhetoric that we regularly hear — I associate it especially
    with the web application development community — about the
    advantages of network effects and the advantages of ubiquity.  I
    think the biologist Richard Dawkins<footnote><para>With the invention of the concept of <emphasis>meme</emphasis>, in his book
          <emphasis>The Selfish Gene</emphasis>.</para></footnote> has spawned
    (particularly in the IT community for some reason) a whole
    generation of intellectual social Darwinists who evaluate ideas
    exclusively in termes of how widely they spread, and not how how
    coherent or true they might be.  This is a sort of
    propagandists’ view of ideas, whose coarseness and
    naïveté would shame even the most outrageous of the
    19th century thinkers who invented that misapplication of
    biological theory to human ethics which is social
    Darwinism.</para><para>So it’s nice to have some cases where advantages will
    accrue and new possibilities will open up regardless of whether
    anybody else sees them or adopts the new technology or not, where
    the advantages accrue for individuals and not just huge
    collectives.  It's nice because it frees us from the need to make
    technological choices based solely on our predictions about what
    other people are going to think is good technology; it allows us
    to evaluate the technology on its merits.  As technical people,
    most of us are likely to be better at evaluating the technical
    merits of technologies than at predicting the crowd psychology of
    marketplaces.  As Michael Kay said several times during this
    conference, “I really hate to try to make predictions about
    the future.  It’s very hard.” That’s true for all of
    us.</para><para><!--* But that&ap;s again one of the reasons some of us got
    interested in descriptive markup.  *-->I had occasion recently to
    reread the paper published by James Coombs, Allen Renear, and
    Steve DeRose in the November 1987 <emphasis role="ital">Communications of the ACM</emphasis>,<footnote><para>ACM = Association for Computing Machinery.</para></footnote> and I was struck that they say:
    
    <blockquote><para>We do not advocate waiting for SGML to become dominant.  As we
        have illustrated, [<emphasis>Aside: Only illustrated, not
          proven? Interesting, Dr. Renear.</emphasis>] descriptive
        markup is vastly superior to both presentational and procedural
        markup.  The superiority of descriptive markup is not dependent
        on its becoming a standard; instead, descriptive markup is the
        basis of the standard because of its inherent superiority over
      other forms of markup.</para><para>Those of us who have converted to descriptive markup are
        already enjoying some of these outlined benefits. ... [<xref linkend="Coombs"/>]</para></blockquote>  
  </para><para>I think that’s true, and it’s useful to focus on the
    benefits you can get by adopting a technology even if the browser
    makers or the large community of web application developers never
    see it and never adopt it.  In that respect I’m particulary
    grateful to Eric van der Vlist for showing us how we can bring
    hypertext on the web forward into the 1960s<footnote><para>This is a veiled reference to the way Bill Smith of Sun,
        then the chair of the W3C XLink working group, used to
        describe that group's goal.  Unfortunately, they did not
        achieve it.

    that run in browsers today without requiring that we persuade the
    guys at Netscape or Opera or those other places [<xref linkend="Vlist01"/>].</para><para>On the other hand, as that quotation from Mallarmé
    illustrates, turning over a new leaf may open so many new
    possibilities that the experience becomes a little paralyzing.
    Working with metalanguages can make things so abstract it’s
    hard to find your way.  And working with standards or
    specifications that leave a lot freedom to their implementors and
    their uses can leave so many possibilities open that you wonder
    whether you gained anything at all by adopting the standard or
    using the specification.  When you’re using PDFs, at least
    there is a Big Daddy over there in San Jose that tells the world
    what PDFs mean, and it doesn’t matter how gnarly they get
    inside, because the only people who see the gnarliness inside a
    PDF file are the people who write PDF display software, and most
    of them work for Adobe and are very well paid, and the others will
    either do the same thing the Adobe browser does or they will be
    punished, and we don’t need to worry about it.</para><para>XML, SGML, descriptive markup in general, takes away that
    comforting dependence on somebody else to decide what’s
    important and what counts.  It puts the responsibility on you, and
    that can be frightening.  Even when we do not find it frightening,
    it can be an onerous responsibility.  As a well-known critic of
    SGML (Darrell Raymond) once said, “Descriptive markup frees
    authors from the tyranny of typography only to plunge them
    headlong into the hellfire of ontology.”<footnote><para>This pronouncement (cited from memory) appeared in an
        early draft of the paper ultimately published as <xref linkend="Raymond"/>; from
        a rhetorical point of viuew, it’s a bit of a shame that
        they took this sentence out before they actually published the
        paper, but perhaps they thought it was too inflammatory.
      </para></footnote>
 </para><para>You see traces of that difficulty in the problem that Norm
    Walsh talked about: the difficulty of finding an editor that end
    users will like that preserves the freedom that XML gives you
    [<xref linkend="Walsh"/>].  It’s a lot easier to write simple
    interfaces if the user doesn’t have that many possibilities.
    Sometimes freedom is bewildering and threatening.  The report by
    Ravit David and others, on their experience loading XML ebooks,
    illustrates those difficulties [<xref linkend="David"/>].  Jeff
    Beck’s report on the self-delusions you may fall into when
    you’re working in a closed system [<xref linkend="Beck"/>] is
    also relevant here.  One of the sentences that people will
    remember from this conference is the observation “If XML is
    like a conversation, running a closed XML system is like listening
    to the voices in your head.”<!--* (I like that. Thank you,
    Jeff. I&ap;m going to remember that.) *--></para><para>And, of course, when anything at all is possible, the person
    you’re listening to may be lying.  I bet most of you didn’t
    realize that Lynne Price’s game was part of the technical
    program. I didn’t either until I realized: it’s another
    instantiation of this problem. <footnote><para>On the second day of Balisage 2011, Lynne Price organized
        a lunchtime <quote>entertainment</quote> under the title
        <emphasis>Balisage bluff</emphasis>, in which improbable
        markup-related tales were told and the audience had to try to
        tell which were truth and which were fiction.</para></footnote>  Infinite possibilities include infinite methods of
    deceit and threat.  And even if your interlocutors are not trying
    to deceive you, they may just be plain wrong, as Ken Sall mentioned
    this morning [<xref linkend="Sall"/>].  Did Jeff Beck really play
    on that record, and if so, was it this Jeff Beck or was it a
    different Jeff Beck?  Maybe I have always thought that Jeff was a
    great guitar player in his spare time — I only saw one side
    of him, as a markup geek at the National Library of Medicine,
    but in his secret life he was a rock star.
    [<emphasis>Laughter.</emphasis>]<!--*  It&ap;s a namespace
    problem. *--></para><para>Sometimes, possibly for this reason — it seems related
    — the way forward seems to be not to open up more
    possibilities but to start closing possibilities down. That’s
    why many people thought then and think now that Scribe was a step
    forward vis-à-vis troff.  Why?  Because it cut off a whole
    lot of spaces, particularly spaces of bad typography and bad
    document structure, and put a very limited palette of
    possibilities in front of the user.  It’s one of the things
    that the designers of XML tried to accomplish with XML: to close
    off some of the possibilities of SGML.  Let’s not fool
    ourselves; there is a loss of flexibility in XML vis-à-vis
    SGML.  The design goal was to make that loss of flexibility
    involve the things you don’t care about and not the things you
    do care about.  So XML doesn’t reduce possibilities for the
    document owners or the vocabulary designers, only for the software
    developers.  There’s a trade-off: You have to think
    “Which is more valuable to you?  Having more conforming
    parsers than you can count on the fingers of a single hand (and
    more non-conforming parsers than you can count on fingers and
    toes, and possibly some fingers and toes of some friends)?  Or, on
    the other hand, the ability to use backslash rather than ampersand
    as a general entity reference opener?” On the whole, I’m
    happy to give up on a backslash as a general entity reference open
    delimiter in order to have more parsers.  So I’m happy with
    that trade-off.  And those of us who prefer to use SGML can still
    use SGML because it’s there; it’s a spec, and its
    implementations are not going away, although, as far as I know,
    most of them have not been updated recently.

  </para><para>That same simplification through reducing choices is probably
    responsible for the fact that many, many more people use TEI-Lite
    than full TEI.  You can’t use full TEI without making an awful
    lot of decisions.  Quite often they’re decisions that you
    don’t feel in a position to make upfront because until
    you’ve had some experience you don’t know whether you want
    that module or not.  Blind interchange similarly requires closing
    off possibilities and reducing variation. (We’ll come back to
    that.)  To write any text at all on the page — even a text
    as beautiful as the poem <emphasis role="ital">Sea
      Breeze</emphasis> — Mallarmé [<xref linkend="Mallarme"/>] had to take a stand; he had to put something
    down on the page.  He had to shut out an infinite number of other
    possible texts in order to get the text he did write, and he had
    to risk an ink blot or two.  Similarly, growing up requires that
    you stop changing your mind about what you want to be when you
    grow up and start focusing; at least, that’s what I’ve been
    told by people who have grown up.</para><para>Even at relatively low levels, regularity, predictability, and
    explicit structure can open up new possibilities.  The simple
    regularity of markup — the ability to distinguish markup
    from non-markup — allows Daniel Jettka and Maik
    Stührenberg to produce tools to do visualization of documents
    [<xref linkend="Jettka"/>].  You know, visualizing the structure of TeX
    documents or troff documents would be an NP-complete problem.  It
    would require artificial intelligence because you would
    essentially have to write a troff processor and then you’d have
    to do artificial intelligence to analyze the shape of the page to
    decide what the structure of the document was.  Having the
    structure explicitly marked allows Jettka and Stührenberg to
    draw trees without occupying the mainframe computer center for
    three weeks in order to document the structure of the first
    document they try, and then another three weeks to get the second
    one to compare with it.  Consider the paper of Jean-Yves
    Vion-Dury, in which he exploits the distinction between markup and
    content in order to encrypt them differently so that you can
    semi-trust people, semi-trusting your service vendors so they can
    perform operations without having to understand either the
    operations or your documents fully [<xref linkend="Vion-Dury"/>].  You couldn’t do that if you
    didn’t have a reliable guide to the structure that you’re
    exposing to them (or, in some cases, potentially hiding from them)
    independent of the content.  Or recall the work that Jacques
    Durand did in XTemp [<xref linkend="Durand"/>]; I think that’s
    aided by
    the generality at one level and the utter predictability at
    another level of the message structure of the messages they have
    to deal with.</para><para>Now, the difficulties of uncertainty and freedom, and the
    advantages of restriction — I’m tempted to say
    “voluntary slavery” — apply not just at the
    psychological level and not just at the application level (even at
    a very low level).  Why are Michael Kay and O’Neil Delpratt
    able to optimize certain things and not others [<xref linkend="Delpratt"/>]?  They are able to optimize those things
    which they can decide at compile time, and they cannot optimize
    things which cannot be determined until run time.  If they know,
    at compile time, that certain things are not going to happen at
    run time, then they can compile into byte code, and the stylesheet
    can run faster. Freedom leads to uncertainty, and uncertainty
    leads to doubt, and doubt leads to ... slower processing ... at
    many, many levels.</para><para>Eliminating the possibilities that you don’t want to
    exercise can help in a lot of ways.  To inter-operate with other
    software, to make XML data more tractable for people who don’t
    have an XML mindset requires clean APIs — requires APIs like
    the one Liam Quin sketched, which try to make XML easier to write
    for people who don’t think in XML [<xref linkend="Quin"/>].  We
    may wish that they would just start using native XML programming
    languages like XQuery and XSLT, but historically they have
    perversely enough exercised their freedom not to do so. And rather
    than putting them in chains and forcing them, it’s probably a
    good idea to try to make things easy. Similarly, I’m happy to
    see the work on XML serialization into C# and Java Objects that
    Carlos Jaimez-Gonzalez described [<xref linkend="Jaimez-Gonzalez"/>], or the packaging work that Chris
    Maloney described this morning [<xref linkend="Maloney"/>].  To
    make progress on certain tasks, including the development of
    applications, can just require that you put your head down and you
    make decisions and you put a stake in the ground and you risk an
    ink blot or two.</para><para>Recall the work of Julien Seinturier on XML engines for
    multimodal linguistic annotations [<xref linkend="Seinturier"/>],
    or similarly, Alexander “Sasha” Schwarzman’s
    description of the work he and others have done dealing with all
    the complications of supplemental material for journal articles
    [<xref linkend="Schwarzman"/>].  Those case studies reflect one of
    the kinds of work we need to do in order to make XML realize some
    of the possibilities for our culture that we want it to realize,
    even though, of course, one of the first things you discover when
    you do that kind of work is that you’ve uncovered a whole lot
    of new problems you didn’t know you had before, including
    the perennial problem “Oh, this is really interesting, but
    who is actually going to pay for this additional work for the
    preservation of this additional material?” We now know
    it’s essential, but we haven’t necessarily found new
    income.</para><para>I have seen the future, and it will require better
  documentation.</para><para>That’s part of the cussedness of human beings.  Human
    beings can do things in a whole lot of different ways.  We can
    understand each other because out of the infinite number of
    possible human languages, there is only a finite number of human
    languages actually in use at any given time and an even smaller
    finite number that are typically used in a particular location. So
    if we address each other in 21st-century English or 21st-century
    French, here in Montréal, we’re likely to succeed fairly
    quickly in finding a language that our interlocutor understands.
    Fortunately, we can restrict our attention to 21st-century English
    and 21st-century French — We don’t have to experiment
    with Chaucerian English or Old High German or Gothic or Uyghur or
    historical versions of that very large number of attested
    languages. But if we want to preserve our information for the
    long-term, the recipients of that information in the long-term
    won’t have all of the context that we have that reduces the
    number of possibilities we have to try. So as David Dubin reminded
    us the other day [<xref linkend="Dubin"/>], we are going to have to document things a
    lot better than we might think.  It is precisely those things
    which are so obvious that we don’t think of them as needing
    documentation, the things that would be almost an insult to say
    explicitly (because it would make your interlocutor wonder whether
    you doubt their mental capacity) that may be most important to
    document.  So I’m glad that people like David Dubin or people
    like Daan Broeder and Andreas Witt and Oliver Schonefeld and their
    colleagues are working on long-term preservation [<xref linkend="Dubin"/>,
    <xref linkend="Broeder"/>] and how to make it work, and trying to
    figure out how to elicit the documentation that we need and how to
    store it in ways that people in the future will have a fighting
    chance at understanding.</para><para>Sometimes we may resist nailing things down because there’s
    the risk of getting it wrong; there is the risk of foreclosing
    possibilities that were really what we wanted.  And I’ll tell
    you a story I’m embarrassed about: Sometime late in the
    development of the XML 1.0 spec, Dan Connolly who was the W3C
    staff contact for the Working Group, said to me, “What is an
    XML document?  Of what set of objects is the set of XML documents
    a subset?” And I said, rather guardedly, “Why do you
    want to know?” I had worked enough with Dan that I was
    worried about a trap.  And he said, “It’s just a sort of
    intellectual hygiene; it’s part of the definition of any set.
    Modern set theory says if you want to make sure that it’s safe
    to apply the axioms and theorems of set theory, you have to define
    sets in certain ways to avoid well-known intellectual
    problems.” And I said, “You know, I really don’t
    think that we’re going to run into Russell’s Paradox if we
    don’t specify whether an XML document is a string of characters
    or an abstract structure of some kind, so no, I don’t want to
    go there.”<footnote><para>Russell's Paradox arises whenever we assume that for any
        property we can describe, we can assume a set of things that
        have that property.  Some sets, Russell observed, have the
        property that they are members of themselves, others the
        property of not being members of themselves.  But consider the
        set of all sets which are not members of themselves — is
        it a member of itself or not?  If not, then it should be; if
        so, then it should not be.  Either way of deciding the
        question leads directly to a contradiction.
      </para><para>
        Over the years, mathematicians have proposed a number of rules
        for the definition of sets whose primary motivation is to
        ensure that no analogue of Russell's Paradox can arise in the
        system so constrained; the rule mentioned by Dan Connolly is
        imposed by Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory, which is the most
        commonly used axiomatic system for set theory.  
      </para></footnote> I have no idea whether anybody else in the Working
    Group thought about this problem; Dan and I, I think, were talking
    offline, and I resisted because I did not want to nail down the
    nature of an XML document in a specific way because I foresaw that
    other people would use that to sort of close down other
    possibilities.  And the result has, of course, cost later working
    groups some indeterminate number of months or years<footnote><para>If we count person-months, the number is way too high, so
        we’re talking about multiple person-years or person-decades
        of time.</para></footnote>
    trying to patch problems in the formal underpinnings of their
    specifications.  Some XML specifications, for example, appeal to
    the notion of identity of XML elements — these two things,
    they may say, are the same if they are, or are derived from, the
    same XML element.  Sometimes, working group members are surprised
    to discover that their specification has a hole in its foundation
    as a result, since the XML spec doesn’t actually define
    identity criteria for XML documents or XML elements.  If identity
    is not defined for XML elements, you cannot appeal to identity of
    XML elements to determine the identity or non-identity of other
    things of interest to your specification.<footnote><para>Sometimes, working group members are not only surprised,
        but are upset with me for pointing this out, even while they
        hotly deny that it is true.   Sometimes they also deny that it
        matters, even if it were true.
      </para></footnote> And it’s my fault.</para><para>It would be better to have nailed it down.  It would be better
  to have identified the possibilities I was trying to keep open and
  define each of them, so that we had terms with which we could talk
  about them.</para><para>
    Trying to avoid nailing things down may be understandable when
    you’re trying to preserve possibilities, but trying to avoid
    clarity is not the right way.  So I’m grateful to Allen Renear
    and his colleagues, even though I disagree with them on the nature
    of the identifier <emphasis>I42</emphasis>. I’m grateful to
    them for asking the question “What is the logical form of a
    metadata record?” [<xref linkend="Renear"/>] It’s the right kind of question; it’s an
    essential kind of question that we need to ask. I’m grateful to
    Walter Perry for asking a related question [<xref linkend="Perry"/>].  It’s true that you may risk, when you
    talk about these things, having someone stand up and say,
    “I’m lost.”<footnote><para>It should perhaps be mentioned, for the benefit of those
        who didn't attend the conference, that this did in fact happen
        to Walter Perry, who took it in stride.</para></footnote> But we have to ask these questions; it will take us a
    while to find answers that we can successfully communicate to each
    other, but if we don’t ask the questions, we’re never going
    to get there.  And I’m grateful to Lars Johnsen and Claus
    Huitfeldt for the same reason; I don’t understand what those
    lattices they are talking about mean, but I now know there’s
    something I have to work on understanding [<xref linkend="Johnsen"/>].</para><para>But now we have a contradiction.  (Some of you will have
    noticed this some time ago, but it took me a while to get around
    to it.)  Now we have a contradiction because on the one hand we
    want openness and we want freedom and we want flexibility, but we
    notice that that sometimes leads to paralysis.  And on the other
    hand, we want to avoid closed-down options and foreclosure of
    possibilities and inflexibility and rigidity, but if we also want
    blind interchange and interoperability, that seems to be the way
    to get there.  How do we balance these competing interests?  Do we
    have to choose one and let the other one go to the dogs?  Can we
    trade them off somehow?  Do we have to choose whether to eat the
    cake today or save it for tomorrow?  <!--* Someone advised me this
    morning apropos of the bagels, &ldquo;Eat, drink, and be merry,
    for tomorrow we will diet.&rdquo; *--> Or can we have them both?
    And what I think of as the big theme of this conference is
    precisely the question: Can we have them both?  In his paper,
    Eliot Kimber explained the way DITA has striven to make the notion
    of architectural forms concrete and executable and managed to make
    DITA comprehensible in ways that I had ever managed to find it
    before [<xref linkend="Kimber"/>].  The DITA approach, as he
    described it, seems to provide a way to have a certain kind of
    freedom within constrained limits and provide precisely the
    constraints that you need in order to allow at least a certain
    level of quality in default processing — to have at least
    some of the advantages of both poles.  And if things work right
    and if you get the right set of primitive types, maybe the
    advantages you have over here that are preserved and the
    advantages you have over there that are preserved and not lost are
    the ones you care about, and the advantages that you’ve lost
    are the ones you didn’t care about, like changing your
    delimiters.</para><para>Syd Bauman’s talk touched on that very topic of interchange
    and interoperability [<xref linkend="Bauman"/>].  Wendell Piez
    discussed ways to provide controlled extension points, not just in
    the schema and not just outside the schema: having them both
    seemed to suggest a way that we may be able to manage those
    difficult trade-offs [<xref linkend="Piez"/>].  I still don’t fully understand this, but the
    DITA mechanism that Eliot described and the local extensibility
    mechanisms that Wendell described feel to me similar at some deep
    level to the definition of forward processing in processor
    specs.</para><para>Another anecdote: The XML Schema Working Group was aware that
    versioning was a terribly difficult problem, and we were
    desperately afraid of getting it wrong, so in XSD 1.0 we in fact
    said nothing.  The XSLT Working Group — the group that
    developed XSLT 1.0 — was also aware that it was important,
    and they were also afraid of getting it wrong, but they took a
    risk and defined a forward processing mode for XSLT 1.0
    processors.  And as Michael (Kay), or anybody who has actually
    worked with XSLT 1.0 processors in the presence of XSLT 2.0
    stylesheets, will tell you, they didn’t get it completely
    right, and the parts they did get right weren’t always
    correctly implemented, but ask yourself: “Which set of users
    is currently in a better situation in the presence of new
    constructs?  The users of XSD 1.0 or the users of XSLT 1.0?”
    I am in both sets, and I tell you I am a lot happier as an XSLT
    programmer than I am as a schema writer, because the one way to be
    absolutely sure of getting it entirely wrong is to say nothing in
    a misguided attempt to leave all of your options open.</para><para>There comes a time for opening things up, and there is a time
  for closing things down.  One part of growing up is realizing that
  some problems don’t have a permanent solution, so the times
  for opening things up and the times for closing things down are
  likely to alternate, and you’ll have to decide what kind of
  time is this.  We’re not going to find any permanent
  solution to the problem of deciding which kinds of freedom we have
  to preserve and which kinds of voluntary slavery are worth entering
  into.  Those are questions that require human judgment.  One of the
  things we can do as technology people is to help make tools that
  will support that human judgment and allow humans to make human and
  humane judgments and not be consumed by clerical work.  To make
  those tools we are, from time to time, going to have to close down
  some possibilities, to keep things as simple as they can be (but
  remember security), to take a stand, to put a stake in the ground,
  to risk an ink blot, to work not just at a metalanguage level or the
  meta-metalanguage level or the meta-meta-metalanguage level, but
  — gasp! — at the object level, to write real documents
  and real vocabularies and to say relatively concrete things about
  relatively concrete entities.</para><para>Right now it’s time to close down Balisage 2011 so you
  can all go home and do that work.  Soon enough it will be time for
  the pendulum to swing in the other direction, when what you will
  want to do is to think about the new things that you learned here
  that you haven’t thought before, to look at your problems
  from a new angle, to open up your mind again to new possibilities.
  I can think of a really good place to open up your mind to new
  possibilities, to do that kind of thing. So “So long!”
  and I look forward to seeing you in Montréal for Balisage
  2012.</para><bibliography><title>Bibliography</title><bibliomixed xml:id="Banski">Bański, Piotr. “<link xlink:href="http://www.balisage.net/Proceedings/vol7/html/Banski01/BalisageVol7-Banski01.html" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="new" xlink:actuate="onRequest">Literate
