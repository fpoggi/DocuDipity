        hierarchical relations, in text. A LMNL processor can parse this syntax (or any other syntax,
        if mapped) into a generalized data model, which can be queried and processed. Among the
        applications that LMNL supports readily is the creation of visual "sketches" of the markup
        on a document, e.g. using SVG. Such sketches can discover and depict any range relations of
        interest. It turns out the overlap is often less interesting than the hierarchies.</para><para>Examining texts showing overlapping hierarchies (MCH or multiple concurrent hierarchies)

      experimenting with an unorthodox approach to document markup, LMNL (the Layered Markup and
      Annotation Language), conceived by Jeni Tennison and myself with significant contributions and
      support by others. LMNL is similar to XML in its conceptual architecture, distinguishing
      between a markup syntax and a data model capturing an abstraction of <quote>text</quote> as it
      is described by the syntax. Unlike XML, however, the LMNL data model represents arbitrary
      ranges over text; in particular, ranges that have any or no hierarchical relation to one
      another are as easily handled as those that fall into the familiar nested element structure of
      XML documents.</para><para>A simple example (five lines of a poem by Robert Frost) illustrates the syntax<note><para>One reviewer recalls correctly that LMNL is defined as a data model, capable of
          various syntactic representations. This is correct, but LMNL also has something we called
            <quote>LMNL syntax</quote>, defined separately from the model and implementable in its
          own right (inasmuch as it was a text-based format). Not everyone who built a LMNL
          application has had occasion to use the syntax much; but my experiments with Luminescent
            (<xref linkend="Piez2012"/>) show it is feasible in principle.</para><para>For those who wish for more formal references, I offer (with apologies) several
          antiquated documents archived at <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="new" xlink:actuate="onRequest">http://lmnl-markup.org</link>.</para></note> in its bare

...{quatrain]...{octave]...{sonnet]</programlisting></para><para>Interestingly, an approach to markup that permits arbitrary overlap, as does LMNL, turns
      out to be highly convenient for marking up multiple concurrent hierarchies (MCH), albeit with
      no built-in "awareness" of them in the model. (These hierarchies, that is, are entirely
      implicit in the data model until they are resolved and processed as hierarchies by a
      processor.) So, in the example just given, two concurrent hierarchies may be discerned in the
      poem. One hierarchy constitutes the formal structure of the sonnet as an example of English
      verse, in which (as represented here) lines are combined into couplets, tercets, quatrains,
      sestets, octaves—some of which may contain other such structures. (So an octave of eight lines
      may decompose into two quatrains of four lines each.) The other constitutes the structure of
      grammar and rhetoric (argument): phrases are joined to constitute sentences. Because sentences
      and indeed phrases may overlap verse structures, these two hierarchies do not align at every
      point. Yet they can nevertheless be discerned, separately or together, within the <quote>range
        space</quote> of the text.</para><para>MCH is readily visualized in a toolset able to process LMNL markup, build a range model
      from it, and generate an SVG diagram showing the ranges, as illustrated for this poem in <xref linkend="BirdsAndEveGraph"/>. Such a toolset was demonstrated at Balisage 2012 (<xref linkend="Piez2012"/>).<note><para>In case you are wondering, no claim is made that anything can be done here that cannot
          be done in XML without LMNL. LMNL just makes it really really easy because we don't have
          to support XML-based workarounds for dealing with ranges, multiple hierarchies or overlap.
          In XML, we are faced with an XML (engineering) task even before we can get on with the
          markup task.</para></note></para><figure xml:id="BirdsAndEveGraph"><title>A sonnet by Robert Frost</title><mediaobject><imageobject><imagedata fileref="../../../vol13/graphics/Piez01/Piez01-001.png"/></imageobject></mediaobject><para>Of particular interest here is the overlap between ranges marked <code>s</code> and
          <code>phr</code> (marking sentences and phrases) and ranges indicating the formal
        structure of the first (<code>line</code>, <code>quatrain</code> etc.) Indicating how some
        lines are end-stopped, while others enjamb (phrases break across them), these incidences of
        overlap between the two hierarchies—which are largely, but not entirely congruent—reveal the
        movement of the poem's language across its formal foundation.</para></figure></section><section><title>The reign of the OHCO</title><para>The acronym OHCO, for Ordered Hierarchy of Content Objects, was coined in 1990 to describe
      a tree-shaped data model for texts, or <quote>documents</quote> (we set aside an examination
      of what these terms should mean here), in a seminal discussion of text encoding presented by
      Allen Renear and colleagues at Brown University (<xref linkend="Renear1990"/>). The argument
      presented in that paper makes two claims: first, that a hierarchical model is superior to
      alternatives then prevalent for purposes of electronic document production and application,
      supporting necessary operations that are not so easily addressed by other data models then prevalent;<note><para>Certainly this point of view has been vindicated; if we do not today speak much of
          OHCOs, in our DOMs, trees, and directed acyclic graphs, we have infrastructures for OHCO
          under other names.</para></note> and second, that this superiority is not merely pragmatic (an aspect of design and
      functionality), but due to the fact that such a model accurately reflects what a document
      actually <emphasis role="ital">is</emphasis> (as an abstraction, in the instance, or by
      definition). In the years since this argument was first made, its authors qualified and
      prevaricated to a degree (see, for example, <xref linkend="Renear1993"/><footnote><para>Indeed, the 1993 consideration (<xref linkend="Renear1993"/>) of all the problems that
          come with an overly-exclusive OHCO remains an excellent overview of the issues, twenty
          years later. With apologies to DeRose, Durand and Mylonas, in this paper I may sometimes
          refer to them mistakenly under the name <quote>Renear</quote>.</para></footnote>) in an effort to meet objections on several levels; but Renear, at least, has
      never given up the core metaphysical claim (for example, see <xref linkend="Renear2004"/>).
      Nor has he really had to, because, despite many objections, the first argument made by that
      paper has clearly carried the day (at least on the web), as SGML, XML, the HTML DOM and
      numerous other technologies have all verified the usefulness and power of the recursive,
      tree-shaped model. </para><para>The OHCO thesis attributes three fundamental properties to texts, interdependent but
      distinct. First, a text is a hierarchy (the H in OHCO). Secondly, it is ordered (the O): we
      cannot simply take the constituent parts of a text (such as the lines in a sonnet by Robert
      Frost) and treat them as unordered, or re-order them, without altering (and thereby in some
      sense destroying) the text they make up together. Third (the CO), that these constituent parts
      all have <quote>thingness</quote>: they too may be complex (ordered hierarchies of smaller
      objects); and in any case they have distinct properties or sets of properties—we might say
      they are <quote>typed</quote>. So, although a system is not free to rearrange the objects that
      constitute a text, when it comes to objects of a given type (such as paragraphs, list items,
      or lists containing list items), we can treat them all alike. They are interchangeable, if not
      quite in the sense that one can be substituted for another, then at least insofar as they
      share essential properties that makes it both possible and correct to unify their handling in
      a system. This promises a satisfying power of generalization, since by this account, all
      sonnets can be handled alike, as can all their lines. Where there are exceptions to this, the
      system can and must account for them by subtyping or otherwise qualifying the types (so in XML
      we may assign attributes to elements to drive special handling) or by resolving differences
      based on their ordered, hierarchical relations (their <quote>context</quote>). Thus, if some
      lines in a poem appear with extra vertical white space on the page, this is not because they
      are different, as lines, from others, but because the poem as a whole (or perhaps a
      constituent <quote>stanza</quote> object) is displayed with extra spacing that belongs
      properly to it, not to its pieces.</para><para>Note that from the point of view of today's technologies, this powerful and elegant
      account of text as <emphasis role="ital">system</emphasis> and <emphasis role="ital">organization</emphasis> provides a rationale and justification for two things we have
      learned (since the thesis was proposed in 1990) to separate. On the one hand, in data models
      for XML, we have the ordered hierarchy. On the other, in the idea of a regulation and indeed a
      grammar of element types, we have a rationale for schemas. XML's parent standard, SGML,
      assumed that both were necessary together (in fact in SGML, the document's hierarchical form
      is arguably a side effect of the fact that it is specified with a grammar of element types).
      XML disentangles this dependency—its more consistent syntax maps to a hierarchy irrespective
      of element types and prescribed relations—and in doing so, acquires much greater flexibility
      in application. (This is not to say that XML is more expressive or capable of any application
      than SGML; only that because the XML parse can happen without reference to any schema or
      element specification, XML tools become more lightweight, easier to use and easier to build
      with than SGML tools.) Defining exactly what our content objects are and how they are to be
      treated may now be performed late, forgoing processes such as validation or data binding until
      they are known to be useful. Yet irrespective of the semantics of particular element types, an
      XML parser knows about elements and attributes, and can always present the hierarchy of
      elements for processing. So the tree remains: always there, always dependable, always
      addressable and processable using generic technologies designed for the purpose, such as
      XPath, XSLT and XQuery.</para><para>All of this was a very positive development for developers of publishing systems or data
      processing systems in general—and so, indirectly, for users and communities. Yet at the same
      time, handling <quote>overlap</quote> in its various forms has remained a complication (at
      worst, a prohibitive one) for many applications of XML, especially applications whose purpose
      is not simply to create and process new texts or new versions of old texts (for example, in
      publishing activities), but to represent texts for scholarly or research purposes, as they are
      found, in all their complexity and nuance. The <emphasis role="ital">retrospective</emphasis>
      encoding of texts (see <xref linkend="Piez2001"/>) would offer encodings of documents that
      trace what we see in them, irrespective of any prior commitments to how these texts are (or
      should be) defined and constituted as texts—<quote>the model of the text has the form of a
        tree</quote> being such a prior commitment.</para><para>This hasn't stopped us from trying. To represent multiple concurrent hierarchies (MCH) in
      XML, or anything that doesn't fit into the hierarchy, we resort to one of several
      well-understood and well-documented workarounds: <quote>milestone</quote> markers, chained
      segments, standoff markup or what have you (see <xref linkend="Barnard1995"/>, <xref linkend="TEIch20"/>). These work by specifying handling for particular elements or
      attributes, in order to represent, indirectly, things (not yet <quote>content objects</quote>)
      that cut across the hierarchy. But this necessitates control of these elements'
      properties—identifiers and pointers to them—which indeed entails prior commitments to element
      semantics, as well as cumbersome and opaque methods of processing that are able to resolve
      these relations according to the kind of representation intended. This inevitably means we do
      not benefit much from schema-free processing, and face significant tagging and validation
      overhead just to represent the phenomena we seek to understand.</para><para>Thus a paradoxical consequence of XML's so-called <quote>overlap problem</quote> is that
      it presents scholars and researchers with a special challenge precisely as we seek to study
      the place, nature and historical development of hierarchies in text. We who are most
      fascinated by the OHCO thesis, and wish most to scrutinize the nature of hierarchies in texts,
      are the most hampered by a data model that imposes a single hierarchy, because we have
      questions not readily addressed when it must be assumed. Because document hierarchies provide
      XML tools with their frames of reference (literally), it is difficult to consider the
      hierarchy of a text, while using XML, as anything but given: using XML to consider how the
      OHCO thesis applies to text is like looking at a rose garden through rose-colored glasses.
      (The world may look nice, but we can only smell, not see, the roses.)</para><para>In particular, it becomes difficult to ask questions, using XML encoding, about texts
      whose hierarchies that are not perfectly regular, or about the relation of multiple
      hierarchies (<quote>views</quote> according to <xref linkend="Renear1993"/>) that appear
      together. Are their relations incidental, or systematic and significant? What accounts for the
      structural regularity of texts? Does a single account serve for all texts, or do various
      kinds, genres, or formats of text show different aspects (features, hierarchies) that suggest
      or demand different explanations? Accepting Renear's argument that the OHCO is a <quote>real
        thing</quote>, where does it come from and how did it come about? Are texts produced before
      the electronic age, as Renear and his colleagues argued, also always ordered hierarchies, and
      do they always have content objects? If so, of what nature are these? With their tree-shaped
      document models, do XML and HTML represent a radical break from prior forms of text, or are
      they a continuity? And if they are a continuity, what do they continue?</para><para>One of the most fascinating things about this inquiry is that it is greatly facilitated by
      a technology, such as LMNL, that allows us to mark up and process text without imposing
      hierarchy at all. Where we can have any hierarchy or none, hierarchy itself is immediately
      open for study.</para></section><section><title>Ironies of alignment</title><para>As illustrated above, it is perfectly possible to discern more than one hierarchy in, say,
      an example of poetry, where we have both formal organization (stanza and line) and grammatical
      structure (sentences and phrases) together. By definition, by distinguishing more than one
      hierarchy, we admit the potential for them to conflict or overlap. (If they were never in
      conflict, then we should be able to accommodate them together within a single hierarchy.) And
      indeed examples of poetry are not hard to find in which there is not perfect alignment between
      these hierarchies.</para><figure xml:id="naturundkunst"><title><quote>Natur und Kunst sie scheinen sich zu fliehen</quote>, by J. W. Goethe (ca.
        1800)</title><mediaobject><imageobject><imagedata fileref="../../../vol13/graphics/Piez01/Piez01-002.png"/></imageobject></mediaobject></figure><figure xml:id="sonnetI"><title>Sonnet I, from <emphasis role="ital">Sonnets to Orpheus</emphasis>, by R. M. Rilke

        fliehen</quote> (ca. 1800; shown in <xref linkend="naturundkunst"/>), and Rilke's Sonett I
      from <emphasis role="ital">Sonnets to Orpheus</emphasis> (1922, <xref linkend="sonnetI"/>).
      The notworthy thing about these examples in this context is the contrast between them. The
      earlier, more <quote>classical</quote> example shows a perfect alignment between meter and
      grammatical structure (one does not need to be a reader of German to see this); the latter
      poem, anything but.</para><para>In each poem, the degree of alignment between these two hierarchies is significant, and
      thematic. Indeed, in each poem, this aspect (especially when we take grammatical structure as
      a proxy for phrasing when read aloud) is integral to the sense of the poem itself, reflecting
      and reinforcing its denotation. Both these sonnets, like many sonnets, are about sonnets.
      Goethe's is a reflection on the art of crafting verse, among other arts, while in Rilke's,
      both the tree of the first line, and the temple it has become in the last, represent the
      singing of Orpheus and thus poetry itself. Goethe's poem might be described as
        <quote>rectilinear</quote> and balanced throughout, while Rilke's shows a kind of eddying
      movement that enacts a transition (weaves a spell, we might say) like the one it describes. In
      other words, we have here a kind of signification: in both cases, whether, how much and where
      the sentence structure aligns with the verse, and where it fails to, is part of the poetry
      itself. It says something. Nor are these two examples at all unusual in this, as a
      consideration of a broader selection can show.</para><para>We might generalize from this to consider what happens when multiple concurrent
      hierarchies align, or fail to. I believe the proper term for the latter situation—where two
      simultaneous arrangements might coincide, but do not—is <emphasis role="ital">irony</emphasis>. Of course, <quote>irony</quote> designates a rhetorical trope (a figure of
      speech or signification) in which the meaning being overtly represented is not the same as the
      meaning being communicated.<note><para>One reviewer asked whether this definition of <citation>irony</citation> wasn’t too
          broad (so weak as not to disinguish irony from other tropes), and I admit that for me
          almost any trope has ironic potential or capability. But I would contrast irony with
          metaphor (for example) in indicating how irony works by a deliberate <emphasis role="ital">failure</emphasis> of alignment, whereas metaphor works through the alignment itself.
          In any case, these are excellent questions.</para></note> More generally, it is a signal, by means of a kind of misalignment or variance from
      expectation, that a meaning should not be taken (at least by a knowing audience) at face
      value; the representation must not only be looked <quote>at</quote>, but also looked
        <quote>through</quote>, with the understanding that what is seen at the different levels may
      not correspond (and that this failure to correspond can itself tell us something). By this
      account, Goethe is not being ironic in his assertion that <quote>only law can give us
        freedom</quote>, and he demonstrates the principle he enunciates.<note><para>At least one reviewer appeared to be under a misconception that I am disparaging what
          is not ironic in favor of the ironic, that Goethe’s work somehow suffers in comparison to
          Rilke's. Nothing could be further from the truth, and to say Goethe’s sonnet is not ironic
          (at least with respect to this particular kind of internal structural alignment between
          sound and form) is not to say that it is not self-conscious (as it certainly is) in other
          ways, for example metaphorically or metonymically. Indeed it might be said that Goethe’s
            <emphasis role="ital">synecdoche</emphasis> here (synecdoche being the <quote>part for
            whole</quote> trope) is deliberately and consciously <emphasis role="ital">not</emphasis> ironic—and that Rilke’s irony would have been impossible without
          it.</para></note> But Rilke's verse is ironic: this poem also follows all applicable rules of
      versification, while at the same time it threatens (or pretends to threaten) to transgress the
      sonnet's strict boundaries in its act of creation. The poem speaks with two voices at once, in
      tension until its end, exuberantly about to burst out of itself at any moment. As readers, we
      are invited to notice this.</para><para>I believe that instances like this have much to teach us about the way texts communicate
      and indeed about the ways in which literary and documentary forms of text serve their
      purposes. Even to characterize it this way gives us an opportunity to see an important
      distinction, if we can generalize to say that <quote>literary</quote> texts are characterized
      by the capacity for this kind of irony (an irony that may confirm or deepen evident senses
      even while it may superficially undermine them), while <quote>documentary</quote> may describe
      that class of texts in which this kind of variance does not happen or is not supposed to. (We
      do not want aircraft maintenance manuals, scientific reports, or maybe even conference papers
      to present such problems for their readers. This is to say nothing in disparagement of texts
      that show little or no ironic transgression of their own forms: they have their own strengths
      and virtues.) If so, this might help explain why an OHCO model is so well suited for so much
      work in publishing and data processing (in which such misalignments within organizations of
      text must be erased or elided lest their complications destabilize regular operations),
      especially for <quote>born-digital</quote> materials (which can be made to conform to these
      constraints in their creation)—while at the same time, a model that imposes a single hierarchy
      can be so frustratingly inept for other purposes, even including the study and representation
      of (something called) <quote>text</quote>. </para></section><section><title>What is text, really?</title><para>Other examples of overlap in literary texts give rise to similar questions, while
      continuing to suggest that such ironies and misalignments are not always bugs, but features,
      indeed essential ones. Of particular interest to students of literature, for example, are the
      structures of formal narrative. Necessarily, as soon as these conflict with logical and
      presentational arrangements (such as chapters and paragraphs, which may normally fail to align
      with narrative and dialogue), a model such as XML's, which reflects a simple OHCO, forces us
      to foreground one or the other hierarchy, while likewise inhibiting our ability to see how
      they work together despite (and because of) their tensions, because whichever hierarchy we
      push into the background is not easily or immediately recognizable as a hierarchy.</para><para>One vivid example of such a text is Mary Shelley's novel of 1818, <emphasis role="ital">Frankenstein, or, the Modern Prometheus</emphasis> (revised 1831). A canonical example of
      the Gothic genre, it shows a set of anomalies that are both interestingly illustrative for
      this text, and yet also suggestive of issues for any such text.</para><para>We will follow the lead of the 1993 revised statement regarding OHCO (<xref linkend="Renear1993"/>) in suggesting that any adequate accounting for what the text
        <quote>is</quote> must correspond at least generally with our intuitions. A very simple
      intuition is that a text (at any rate, a text of the nineteenth century) is going to be a
      sequence of printed (or manuscript) pages; and indeed, one of the first things we find we can
      do using LMNL is mark, as ranges named <code>page</code>, the extents of pages of the novel in
      whatever edition(s) we choose (in this case, the revised edition of 1831, which is the version
      known to most readers), and not only (as is more usual in XML) their starting points. The fact
      that pages may overlap with paragraphs and chapters is not a problem when using a markup
      regime that imposes no containment. And if such a concept of text is evidently too
      unsophisticated to take us far, that's okay too: since the markup technology permits it, we
      can proceed to mark the pages as ranges (not only insert markers for the page breaks) If the
      page hierarchy is interesting (as it may be to students of printed media and their history),
      that is enough. Or even only useful, because it allows us readily to retrieve pages in the
      edition (see <xref linkend="LuminescentQueries"/>). In any case, marking up pages in addition
      to anything else is easy and straightforward, without concern for whether hierarchies will
      inhibit the markup of other features we expect to see on a closer look. We don't have to
      invent, then test and enforce, any special schemes or implicit processing logic to accomplish
      this, resolving the actual <quote>pages</quote>, with their content, and not just breaks
      between them.</para><para>Of course the ordered hierarchy we will usually prefer will be that of of chapters and
      paragraphs. Yet in this novel, these are not quite adequate for a comprehensive account. Not
      only are there an Introduction and a Preface (assuming we consider them to be part of
        <quote>the text</quote>, we can think of them to be specialized chapters if we like), but
      also, we find the chapters of the novel do not account for its entirety. (See <xref linkend="ChaptersOnly"/>). Before the chapters begin we are presented with a framing
      narrative, consisting of letters, one of which (the last) contains several entries, in the
      midst of one of which, the sequence of chapters begins. So the <quote>logical</quote> view is
      deeper than most modern novels, having an epistolary form wrapped around the primary
      narrative—the sort of complication that is not unusual in the Gothic genre. A
        <quote>map</quote> of the novel showing all this structure is presented in <xref linkend="StructureMap"/>.</para><note><para>In RNC notation</para><programlisting xml:space="preserve">novel = element novel {

      the chapter hierarchy is not the <quote>real</quote> hierarchy of the book, but merely
      overlaid on top it, like the pages. Maybe the chapter hierarchy and the hierarchy of letters
      and their entries are in fact two different views. Indeed there is another set of ranges we
      might think about, namely the narrative structure as such. The story appears within a story,
      and within the main story are subordinate narratives: three letters and a long narration by
      Frankenstein's creature himself. This hierarchy can be traced, tagged and mapped as well. In
      fact it should include also direct discourse (that is, spans of dialogue) and other
      attributions and sources, which may overlap and conflict with both paragraph and page
      boundaries. A map of the novel showing this hierarchy is shown in <xref linkend="NarrativeMap"/></para><figure xml:id="NarrativeMap"><title>The narrative structure of the novel</title><mediaobject><imageobject><imagedata fileref="../../../vol13/graphics/Piez01/Piez01-007.png"/></imageobject><caption><para>In this variant, chapters are not shown, and we see only the narrative structure of

            hierarchy still overlaps with the page sequence.</para></caption></mediaobject></figure><para>Mapping out narrative boundaries has always been one of the challenges of OHCO-based
      models, if not because narrative fails at being well structured (typically it does not), then
      because they so often conflict with the <quote>logical</quote> structures of paragraphs and
      sections or chapters—the <quote>published view</quote>. As long as the range space was
      occupied by one and one hierarchy only (that is, as long as the data model recognized only a
      single hierarchy), and as long as the (so-called) logical hierarchy of the published view was
      given pride of place, it has been more or less prohibitively difficult to use XML to mark up
      any hierarchy (or indeed any phenomena at all) that overlapped chapters and paragraphs.
      Paradoxically, the ideology that <quote>descriptive</quote> markup should serve multiple
      purposes, and not be limited to presentation (see <xref linkend="Coombs1987"/>, <xref linkend="Renear2004"/>), may have hindered this also, since there is at least a presumption
      that one should be able to mark up paragraphs and chapters, and yet also mark up everything
      else one might wish to describe. (Because text, by definition, is an OHCO, there will
        <emphasis role="ital">ipso facto</emphasis> never be a conflict between the so-called
        <quote>logical</quote> structure and anything else that is <quote>really there</quote>.) In
      other words, the XML data model interferes with the realization of a regime of descriptive
      markup that is fully adequate to the principle's potential. The range model offered by LMNL
      presents no such difficulties: using LMNL syntax, marking these hierarchies together is only
      as difficult as marking each separately.</para><para>Yet at the same time, there does seem to be a stress between these hierarchies that we do
      not feel, for example, from the misalignment of either of them with the pagination. We do not
      expect pagination to align with anything, regarding it as an incidental consequence of
      typesetting, not a reflection of <quote>the text</quote>. Accordingly, we are tempted to set
      aside the pagination structure as merely incidental to anything else (at least until it turns
      out there is some sort of echoing or consonance). Yet between the narrative and the published
      view (the chapters and paragraphs)—most particularly, since the published view must include
      (for this novel) the letters and entries that <quote>wrap</quote> the chapter sequence (except
      where they don't)—the reader faces a similar kind of phenomenogical stress as we have observed
      in poetry. Is there an irony here, serving any sort of purpose (or creating any sort of
      effect) like the effect of sentences and phrases in poetry pushing and pulling against verse
      lines? Apparently there is, if we consider how our attention hardly shifts, as readers, across
      the boundary in Chapter 24, back out to the framing narrative in which it is embedded, like
      waking up from a nightmare—only to discover it is not a dream, when the monstrous creature at
      the center of the tale next appears on the scene, no longer only hearsay, but breathing,
      speaking, imprecating. (Or so the story says.)</para><para>Thus we are brought back to the text. (Really.) Examining the boundaries between chapters
      (the published view) and the entries in the letters that contain them shows us how we get into
      this trouble in the first place—because the rendering of these transitions in this edition (as
      seen in <xref linkend="pages1831"/>) leaves it somewhat doubtful that the reader will easily
      construe exactly how things are set up—at least as long as she or he is shaking herself awake.
      Indeed, we are inclined to ask, shouldn't Chapter 24 really end on page 188, with
        <quote>Walton, in continuation</quote>? The reader must be the judge. Interestingly, to the
      extent I have been able to determine the question by looking at various editions of this
      frequently-reprinted novel, the 1831 revision by Mary Shelley is actually ambiguous on this
      point, there being no page headers or other indicators to suggest that we are still inside
      Chapter 24 as the framing narrative resumes. Yet in almost every subsequent edition I have
      been able to find, <quote>Chapter 24</quote> page headers continue through to the end.<footnote><para>The only exceptions I have found are the online edition from Romantic Circles (see
            <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="new" xlink:actuate="onRequest">http://www.rc.umd.edu/editions/frankenstein</link>) and a 1934 edition edited by
          Harrison Smith and Robert Haas (with memorable engravings by Lynd Ward), which has no page
          headers, and does promote the <quote>Walton, in continuation</quote> header on the entry
          of August 26 to the level of a chapter heading (thus implicitly ending Chapter 24).</para></footnote></para><figure xml:id="pages1831"><title>Structural boundaries on two pages from the 1831 edition</title><mediaobject><imageobject><imagedata fileref="../../../vol13/graphics/Piez01/Piez01-008.jpg"/></imageobject></mediaobject><para>A few pages later, Frankenstein comes to the end of his narration, and Walton (the

      isn't the case everywhere: indeed, to the extent that they appear to have thought about it at
      all, editors have sometimes been able to <quote>correct</quote> it. In effect, these editions
      make the claim at least implicitly that the rendering of the final passages of Walton's letter
        <quote>inside</quote> Chapter 24 is an error or lapse, and that the correct form of the
      novel is, in fact, more like an ordered hierarchy of content objects. Chapter 1 begins, and
      Chapter 24 ends, the manuscript that Walton transcribes from Victor.<note><para>Since this paper was first drafted, I have learned more about the textual transmission
          of Frankenstein, which complicates this picture significantly, without substantially
          challenging the argument here. In the original 1818 edition, indeed, the chapters (along
          with the framing narrative) are grouped into volumes. Yet the same question arises as to
          whether the final passages (entries in Walton's letter from August 26 - September 12)
          should be included within the last chapter (Chapter VII) of Volume III. Considering them
          as external to it does <quote>regularize</quote> the shape of the novel along similar
          lines to what I have discussed as applying to the structure of 1831—indeed with an added
          dimension, since the tripartite division into volumes reflects the tripartite division of
          Victor's narrative (while it does not entirely correspond with, inasmuch as it must also
          comprise the leading and trailing sections). Moreover, manuscript evidence that a
          two-volume structure was subsequently recast into three volumes suggests that the eventual
          three-volume structure (which neatly corresponds to the clean nesting of a
            <quote>corrected</quote> 1831 text) was a design decision on the part of the author. See
          Robinson (email) 2014, Robinson 1996, SGA [date], and Hindle 1992. Additionally, a set of
          invaluable resources for studying the textual history of the novel is at the Shelley

      hierarchy of entries of letters with their contents. (See <xref linkend="RectifiedMap"/> for
      such a <quote>rectified</quote> view.) This would indeed have the effect of reconciling the
      form of the novel—its internal form, even if its external form (the chapters as typeset) is
      somewhat misleading—into a single ordered hierarchy. The novel is comprised of four letters,
      one of which has several entries; of these, one contains a transcription of a long narrative
      presented in a sequence of chapters. Chapters (or the contents of letters and entries outside
      the chapters) contain paragraphs or other things such as letters and quotations.</para><figure xml:id="RectifiedMap"><title>A <quote>rectified</quote> view of the narrative and chapter hierarchies

      chapter view to a very great extent, if not entirely. The incidences of alignment (or the lack
      thereof) with other factors such as pagination, or quoted dialogue, turn out also to be rather
      interesting, once one starts examining them closely. One can learn a great deal by executing
      queries such as are depicted in <xref linkend="LuminescentQueries"/>. (For example, there is
      the remarkable fact that chapters starting at Chapter 19 all start on new pages, as if they
      had been copy fit: coincidence, or evidence of something?)<footnote><para>On four occasions, dialogue overlaps with paragraphs, but this is not many considering
          there are also 304 marked ranges of directly quoted discourse that do not. Given markup in
          LMNL syntax, a LMNL processor can be used to find these instances (see <xref linkend="LuminescentQueries"/>).</para></footnote> In particular, there is the striking alignment between the story that occurs at
      the center of the novel (the narration told by the creature to Victor, who tells it to Walton)
      and the chapter structure, inasmuch as it contains exactly six chapters, and starts and ends
      with them.<note><para>This is especially interesting in light of the observations of Mary Douglas regarding
            <quote>ring structures</quote> in her amazing treatment of such structures in oral and
          written literature (<xref linkend="Douglas2007"/>). However Mary Shelley came to define
          this structure for the first published edition of Frankenstein—only to revise it or see it
          revised in the subsequent edition of 1831—it certainly <emphasis role="ital">appears</emphasis> to matter that the resulting structure is one that is attested
          elsewhere in imaginative literature.</para></note></para><para>One is left with the inescapable conclusion that the ordered hierarchy of content objects
      is a <quote>real</quote> thing—but also that it is contingent, not necessary, and the result
      of an evolution in media and forms of expression, and in this case only imperfectly realized
      or expressed in the printed medium. We do not have to regard the relation between the
      narrative structure and the formal chapter/paragraph organization as <quote>ironic</quote>;
      instead perhaps other tropes come to mind, perhaps metaphor in this case. Note that here we
      are not speaking of a metaphorical relation between any two levels of any hierarchy, such as
      between Walton's narrative and Victor's contained narrative—which we might also see. Rather,
      it is in the alignment of the structure of the narrative as a set of attested
        <quote>documents</quote> (including Walton's letters and his transcript of Victor's story<note><para>And, intriguingly, perhaps of physical attestation of Victor's veracity in the form of
          transcripts of letters made by the creature and given by him to Victor, who in turn shows
          them to Walton.</para></note>), and the structure of the novel as a published work in conventional
      (chapter/paragraph) form.</para><para>Yet to argue that the correct reading is that these must be aligned, with no possibility
      of intentional misarrangement, as a consequence of what it is to be a text, <quote>because ...
        OHCO</quote> (which is not, mind you, what was ever proposed for OHCO ... it’s just that
      somehow this coincided with the push for SGML, then to be wired into XML), is to suppose we
      know the answer before we have pondered the question. Instead, alerted to the possibility that
      this novel (and others) might well perturb, if not altogether defy, its own well-ordered
      arrangement—the possibility, that is, of an ironic stress between two or more of its internal
      and presented structures—the fact that we can reconcile them here becomes important. If this
      novel is an ordered hierarchy, an arrangement of nested narratives (that happens incidentally
      to be segmented, in part, into chapters), it is a <emphasis role="ital">particular</emphasis>
      ordered hierarchy of particular content objects. Even the possibility of this reading, that
      is, vindicates the idea that such a model (which indeed is satisfyingly symmetrical in this
      case) was indeed part of the concept of the novel itself. The novel is structured as it is not
      because of some prior rule that texts are always hierarchies, but because Mary Shelley
      designed it like this. (She put the hierarchy there much in the way an XML schema designer
      would have. Except that typesetters subsequently failed to understand her full intent, or the
      implication of it.) At the same time, were the typographer to do a better job representing the
      shift back to the framing story when Frankenstein's narrative ends, it would make it no less
      startling (indeed, maybe more so) when the creature himself appears on the scene—by this
      reading, <emphasis role="ital">outside</emphasis> the chapters of the book. A boundary is
      transgressed in either case; indeed in this reading even more strongly, since the separation
      of the framing narrative indicated by a clean ending to Chapter 24 is suddenly broken, and we,
      with the narrator, are brought face to face with something we would prefer never to have
      met.Likewise we can see how our vindication of an OHCO here is only provisional: it applies to
      this novel alone (as long as we take the paginated structure to be incidental, and leave aside
      the occasional misalignment of dialogue speeches with paragraphs), and is liable to slip with
      any new example of a narrative that violates it.</para><para>In this respect Frankenstein is not singular among works of literature. Meanwhile, the
      OHCO is alive and well, but not because it is inevitable or the <quote>only correct</quote>
      and possible way of representing texts. Its power is not in any generalization regarding
        <quote>texts</quote> or some set of artifacts we regard as being <quote>text</quote>, as
      much as it is in its own act of <emphasis role="ital">fiat</emphasis>, its description,
      rationalization and legitimization of hierarchical models in systems as we are building
