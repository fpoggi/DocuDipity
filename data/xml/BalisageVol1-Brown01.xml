      This paper follows up from an initial note drafted by Andrew
      Townley as a result of discussions held during Pensive's
      research and developer boot camp held in Vienna in July
      2007. The two most important themes discussed were the role and
      capture of <emphasis role="ital">context</emphasis> within a specific topic
      map<footnote xml:id="fn1"><para>Note on terminology: "topic
      map", "topic maps" (lower case) refer to a single XTM "instance"
      file, conformant with the Topic Maps (uppercase)
      standard. Uppercase always refers to the standard (and is
      singular).</para></footnote>, and how the Topic Maps paradigm -
      specifically the XTM specification - would allow the linking and
      efficient use of Topic Maps deployed on a massive scale, such as
      the Internet, to support extremely <emphasis role="ital">large-scale
      information sharing</emphasis>. These two subjects initially
      seemed separate concerns, however, upon reflection and further
      discussion, it was clear that they are intertwined. Since July,
      further research and investigation have been done into these
      subjects.
    </para><para>
      In the following we will present a summary of both the initial
      questions raised in Vienna and why they are important as well as
      the state of our current thinking on these two issues.
    </para><para>
      We start with some initial thoughts regarding the importance of
      issues related to context in large-scale Topic Maps
      applications, along with some of the key questions that arose
      during our discussions. These questions will then be addressed
      in more detail in the following sections.
    </para><para>
      The goal of this paper is to put forward some ideas in a broader
      forum and elicit feedback and alternative perspectives. It is
      possible that these ideas have already been discussed elsewhere,
      and we are simply not aware of any consensus previously reached
      regarding them. Hopefully, this paper will help to clarify some
      of these issues and lead towards practical solutions.
    </para><section xml:id="LargeScaleInformationSharing"><title>Large Scale Information Sharing</title><para>
	Large-scale and even global information sharing has become a
	major challenge to the world's governments, both internally
	and internationally. Poor responses of emergency services in
	the wake of the 9/11 and Katrina disasters have made
	information sharing a priority for the U.S. Government
	[<xref linkend="GAO385"/>, <xref linkend="DODIS07"/>], and
	as the single largest purchaser of information technology
	services in the world (US$ 65 billion proposed for FY2008
	budget [<xref linkend="OMBAP08"/>]), it is expected that the
	U.S. Federal Government will require management of vast
	quantities of information and interoperability across an
	extremely diverse set of technology platforms.
      </para><para>
	We were interested in the applicability of the ISO 13250 Topic
	Maps standard to this and similar problems, a discussion which
	threw up a key question: To what extent is Topic Maps
	applicable in large-scale information sharing environments
	such as the Internet? Indeed, does it scale? Furthermore, what
	specific commercial opportunities exist for technology vendors
	in large-scale information sharing environments? And finally,
	which technologies support large-scale information sharing?
      </para></section><section xml:id="ScopeAndContext"><title>Scope and Context</title><para>
	Scope allows multiple views on a particular topic map as well
	as the filtering and adapting of information contained in a
	topic map based on the needs of the user [<xref linkend="PEPP00"/>,
	<xref linkend="PEPP02"/>, <xref linkend="PARK03"/>].
      </para><para>
	Hence the Topic Maps specifications [<xref linkend="ISOTM"/>,
	<xref linkend="XTM"/>, <xref linkend="TMDM"/>] provide a
	mechanism in the <emphasis role="ital">scope</emphasis> construct for
	representing the idea of context. Accordingly the purpose of
	scope is to represent "the context within which a statement is
	valid. Outside the context represented by the scope, the
	statement is not known to be valid. Formally, a scope is
	composed of a set of topics that together define the
	context. That is, the statement is known to be valid only in
	contexts where all the subjects in the scope apply"
	[<xref linkend="TMDM"/>].<footnote xml:id="fn2"><para>There
	is also a note indicating that [<xref linkend="ISOTM"/>] did
	not explicitly define scope to include all subjects, therefore
	there may be some interoperability issues with older topic map
	instances [<xref linkend="TMDM"/>].</para></footnote>
      </para><para>
	Related questions that have been discussed were:
	<itemizedlist><listitem><para>How best to capture context information for
	  various uses within a topic map?</para></listitem><listitem><para>How to filter information in a topic map -
	  including access control to users, in both role-based and
	  mandatory access control models How to dynamically expand
	  and narrow the user's view of the topic map during general
	  exploratory navigation?</para></listitem><listitem><para>How to capture changes or additions to
	  context information after the initial topic map was created?
	  Are these changes new context that needs to be
	  captured?</para></listitem></itemizedlist>
      </para><para>
	And concerning general modelling questions:
	<itemizedlist><listitem><para>Which ontological constructs are best
	  deployed for complex descriptions of context using many
	  topics to define a scope?  </para></listitem><listitem><para>Should they be declared as a single topic
	  which defines an instance of a <emphasis role="ital">bag</emphasis> data
	  type, or should they simply enumerate the individual
	  topics?</para></listitem></itemizedlist>
      </para><para>
	Furthermore the discussion explored the question of how one
	might represent context using associations rather than the
	scope construct, as it seemed potentially to be more dynamic
	and adaptable than what is syntactically allowed by [<xref linkend="XTM"/>]. In discussing a topic map's ability to
	capture context explicitly enough to be useful outside a small
	community using either approach, the discussion naturally
	gravitated to the question of what exactly is meant by
	"context".
      </para></section><section xml:id="WhatIsContext"><title>What Is Context</title><para>
        Context is one of those concepts that most people feel is
        essential to understanding something, but which sparks great
        debate when one attempts to define it. The main issue in the
        scientific and technical communities revolves around whether
        context should be regarded as subjective or objective [<xref linkend="MENZ99"/>]. Once a decision is made regarding one's
        view on context, there is the question of how to represent it
        computationally.
      </para><para>
        <emphasis role="ital">Subjective context</emphasis> is what most people
        understand context to be. It is experiential in nature and
        includes the total of meanings (ideas, assumptions,
        preconceptions and associations) that are related to a thing
        or event and which serve to influence our attitudes,
        judgements, perspectives, and general knowledge of something
        [<xref linkend="AKMA00"/>]. While Menzel argues that
        subjective context always implies an "outer context" which
        exists outside any given context, recursively, that enables
        individuals or intelligent agents to adopt a broader
        perspective to reason about the original context, Bohm's
        theory supports the idea that context and those perceiving it are
        part of a unified whole in much the same way as the observer
        and the observed are related in relativity theory and quantum
        theory [<xref linkend="BOHM80"/>].
      </para><para>
        The ability to leverage separate views of a given situation is
        often useful or indeed necessary, but we need to be aware that
        these separations are not necessarily accurate or complete
        reflections of reality. They must be seen as simply a useful
        mechanism in a particular domain or situation to aid in
        understanding it.
      </para><para>
        <emphasis role="ital">Objective context</emphasis>, interpreted as
        "<emphasis role="ital">outside</emphasis> the skull of any reasoning
        individual", is much more directly related to the works of
        Barwise, Perry, Seligman and Devlin on Situation Theory and
        Information Flow Theory [<xref linkend="MENZ99"/>]. The focus
        of the objective context is the setting in which the objects
        and available information reside and also encompasses the
        relationships between them. The focus of Menzel's work [<xref linkend="MENZ99"/>] is to define a logic for reasoning within
        objective contexts such that a given statement is true in the
        portion of the real world described by a particular situation
        rather than deal with the complexity of the perceptions and
        assumptions involved in how the participants view a given
        interaction. In order to achieve this, it is necessary to
        create a definition of context which exists outside these
        subjective perceptions and which will remain invariant for all
        the participants.
      </para><para>
        Clearly, both definitions of context are attempting to capture
        information about the environment in which an interaction
        takes place in order that some level of shared understanding
        between the participants be established. However, there is a
        considerable difference in the types of information that would
        be included in each definition. Before determining which
        perspective would be the most useful in terms of sharing
        information and knowledge with the Topic Maps standard, it is
        necessary to consider what the goals really are of including
        contextual information in specific topic maps.
      </para></section><section xml:id="ContextFragmentationCommunication"><title>Context, Fragmentation and Communication</title><para>
	By any account, context is an essential part of successful
	communication. In practice, it determines how much information
	must be explicitly stated between the participants and how
	much information is shared between the participants. Akman
	provides the example of late arrival to a meeting [<xref linkend="AKMA00"/>]. In order for the person to understand
	and effectively participate in the ongoing discussion, they
	must establish some of the background on what has already
	happened during the meeting.
      </para><para>
	Establishing an objective context would attempt to capture the
	situation of the meeting, independently of the attitudes,
	beliefs and motivations of the participants because the goal
	of the objective context is to establish "complex, structured
	pieces of the world" [<xref linkend="MENZ99"/>]. It is
	essentially the view that an objective outside observer might
	have of the situation. For example, some of the following
	information would likely be aspects of the objective context:
	<itemizedlist><listitem><para>The names, roles and positions of the meeting participants</para></listitem><listitem><para>The location of the meeting</para></listitem><listitem><para>The materials provided for and present in the meeting</para></listitem><listitem><para>Any notes or diagrams made during the meeting</para></listitem><listitem><para>The time of day of the meeting</para></listitem><listitem><para>The event that one participant arrived late and needed to be "brought up to speed"</para></listitem><listitem><para>The minutes of the meeting capturing the topics discussed</para></listitem><listitem><para>What was said, by whom and how</para></listitem><listitem><para>Any outcomes of the meeting</para></listitem><listitem><para>Any references to any other contexts (situations) mentioned during the meeting</para></listitem></itemizedlist>
      </para><para>
      In respect to the classic journalistic <emphasis role="ital">Five
      W's</emphasis><footnote xml:id="fn3"><para>Also called the Five
      W's (and one H), or "six honest serving men", see the Wikipedia
      article on the Five W's:
      <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="new" xlink:actuate="onRequest">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5_Ws</link>.</para></footnote>,
      a truly objective observer attempting to capture an objective
      context would establish each of the "who", "what", "where",
      "when" and "how", but would be unable to capture any meaningful
      understanding of the "why" beyond any surface remarks made
      during the meeting, e.g. "We are here today to finalize the
      implementation plan for Project X". While this may make any
      given context more easily suited to use by autonomous agents and
      deductive reasoning, it may not accurately reflect the complete
      reality of the situation.
      </para><para>
        Therefore, the real question is how accurately one wants to
        capture "reality" in a particular context. Akman cites several
        examples where the actions and behaviour in a particular
        situation reflect the dramatically different views of reality
        held by the participants [<xref linkend="AKMA00"/>]. Attempting to understand these interactions from an
        objective perspective would likely result in confusing and
        conflicting interpretations, with the person trying to
        understand the situation asking themselves, "now, why did they
        do that?". Searching for the answer to that particular
        question would truly result in insights and new knowledge for
        the person who asked it.
      </para><para>
        In contrast, establishing the subjective context of the same
        meeting would involve some level of understanding the
        participant's <emphasis role="ital">mental models</emphasis>. An
        individual's mental model include all of their experiences,
        beliefs and assumptions about the world. Mental models are
        important to establishing subjective contexts because they
        both reflect and shape an individual's understanding of
        reality [<xref linkend="SENG90"/>],
        i.e. <emphasis role="ital">their</emphasis> concepts of what is true and
        what is not. For the above meeting, knowing the motivations,
        intents and attitudes of the participants may dramatically
        alter one's understanding of actions taken and information
        disclosed during the meeting. This information provides the
        answers to the "why" question seemingly ignored by the
        objective context.
      </para><para>
        Menzel's assertion that subjective context correlates to
        logical theories made up of sets of propositions [<xref linkend="MENZ99"/>] exactly echoes Bohm's earlier theory on
        fragmentation, itself developed as a way to explain some of
        the inconsistencies he found in relativity theory and quantum
        theory. According to Bohm, <emphasis role="ital">fragmentation</emphasis>
        is a result of holding to a theory or set of propositions as
        being a true reflection of reality rather than viewing it as
        insights into a given domain and "which are neither true nor
        false but, rather, clear in certain domains, and unclear when
        extended beyond these domains" [<xref linkend="BOHM80"/>]. These insights are shaped by our mental models, and must
        therefore be subjective. According to Bohm, the true reality
        can never be grasped explicitly; it is an implicit whole that
        is exposed through each subjective context. Recognition of
        context as subjective is a key to greater understanding of a
        particular domain, because it is the interactions and
        boundaries of existing contexts that provide new insights of
        understanding into a particular domain.
      </para><para>
        It would therefore seem that the subjective interpretation
	  of context cannot be ignored. Topic maps are a communications medium
	  to encapsulate and convey information,
        understanding and knowledge about a particular domain. They
        are ultimately created by humans - whether directly authored
        by people or created automatically by software created by
        people - and therefore reflect a subjective view of that
        domain shaped by the implicit factors inherent in any form of
        communication. This means that they will be vulnerable to many
        contextual ambiguities "born out of a misplaced belief on the
        part of the author that the reader has access to the author's
        collective dimension" [<xref linkend="AKMA00"/>].
      </para><para>
        This vulnerability is potentially problematic because of the
        merging process defined by the Topic Maps specification:
        unlike a document or other work created with a particular
        intention and with assumptions about context shared between
        author and readership, information in a specific topic map can
        find itself far outside the context the original author had in
        mind. Consequently, any implicit or shared context will be
        lost. Since context is so critical to effective communication,
        determining how to best capture it is also critical to
        creating effective Topic Maps.<footnote xml:id="fn4"><para>It
        could be argued that this presupposes that knowledge - rather
        than merely information - can be captured and this would imply
        further investigation of so-called tacit and explicit
        knowledge.</para></footnote>
      </para><para>
        It may well be that there are two, arguably conflicting, views
        on the role of topic maps. Is a specific topic map intended as
        something to be studied for greater understanding of a given
        domain, or is it intended to capture a body of information to
        support ad-hoc queries to answer questions about a
        domainâlimited only to the information at hand? How this
        question is answered may have significant implications for the
        type of information and manner used in expressing context
        within the instance.
      </para><para>
        In the first case, the goal is to engage users so that they
        become active participants in the topic map. In this case, the
        information in the specific topic map would act similarly to
        the text in Paul Auster's literature and become "'a
        springboard for the imagination'" [<xref linkend="AKMA00"/>]. The intended use for the topic map is to help the user
        understand something new about the topic map's domain. Knowing
        as much as possible about the domain-view of those capturing
        the information and relationships - including the ontology -
        of the topic map will greatly enhance the process of
        cross-domain information sharing. In this respect, support
        for a more subjective interpretation of context would be
        valuable.
      </para><para>
        If, in the second case, the goal of the topic map is
        essentially to be a sophisticated, multi-dimensional database
        that is able to respond to queries over its contents, then the
        level of contextual information captured may not need to be as
        great, as indicated above. Its goal is not to support deep
        analysis of a domain, but rather to provide, initially at
        least, more superficial views of the domain by offering
        answers to operational needs. Further analysis of the
        responses may prompt a deeper exploration of the information
        <emphasis role="ital">within</emphasis> the domain of the topic map, but
        it is not likely to prompt deeper reasoning
        <emphasis role="ital">about</emphasis> the domain<footnote xml:id="fn5"><para>Note that this statement intentionally
        contradicts Bohm's view that "experience and knowledge are one
        process, rather than [thinking] that our knowledge is about
        some sort of separate experience" given that it would be
        difficult to illustrate the difference of perspective for most
        readers. However, I do not disagree with Bohm's view that
        there can't be a true separation between one's thinking and
        the object being considered as one's perspectives of the
        latter are intrinsically tied to the
        former.</para></footnote>. Therefore, it may be more
        reasonable to assume a more objective interpretation of
        context for this second scenario.
      </para><para>
		In concluding this section, it is worth noting that many of these issues
		are not the exclusive prerogative of the Topic Maps standard.</para></section><section xml:id="ContextAndOntologies"><title>Context and Ontologies</title><para>
	Following Bohm's view that there can never be an explicit view
	of reality as it is and that anyone's individual or shared
	world-view of reality is simply one way or view of the
	implicit whole, ontologies must essentially define the
	boundaries of a particular "domain view", but can never
	represent that domain as the one, true representation. This
	view - sometimes referred to as the "information territory" -
	would seem to confirm that any search for a unifying, fixed
	upper ontology is necessarily futile. From Bohm's viewpoint,
	it may be possible to define a more unified view of the world
	which treats previous views as specializations of the new
	unified view (e.g. Newtonian physics vs. quantum theory), but
	which will still have essential differences and distinctions
	from other views of the same domain [<xref linkend="BOHM80"/>]. It does not imply that this new insight is final,
	however.
      </para><para>
        In this respect, working with Topic Maps benefits from the fact that thestandard
	  does not require content within a particular topic map to conform to
        a fixed ontology. Any ontology used is merely a
        guideline. Therefore, it would seem that Topic Maps has
        potentially the greatest chance of being useful ways of
        capturing knowledge without falling prey to Bohm's theory of
        fragmentation. In his words, "to be confused about what is
        different and what is not, is to be confused about everything"
        [<xref linkend="BOHM80"/>]. The flexibility of Topic Maps
        would tend to allow someone with an awareness of fragmentation
        to be able to view a particular domain and explore the
        relationships not only between the topics and their
        occurrences, but also between the different, fragmentary views
        captured in multiple ontologies. Taken as a device to reason
        <emphasis role="ital">about</emphasis> a particular domain, this could be
        an extremely useful feature of the Topic Maps specification.
      </para><para>
        In a scenario where an ontology is used to define context, it
        becomes critically important to identify the boundaries or
        context in which a particular ontology applies vs. any other
        ontology. While this may be straightforward enough when using
        explicit ontologies, it will obviously prove to be more of a
        challenge for topic maps using implicit ontologies. In the
        same way that every software system has an architecture,
        explicit or not, so too does every topic map have an
        ontology.
      </para></section><section xml:id="ContextRepresentation"><title>Context Representation</title><para>
	While the two mechanisms for representing context defined by
	the Topic Map specifications have been discussed above, there
	has also been considerable work done in the domain of
	Situation Theory in attempting to define a mechanism for
	representing context computationally [<xref linkend="TIN94"/>,
        <xref linkend="AKMA00"/>, <xref linkend="MENZ99"/>].
        Much of that work includes, directly or indirectly,
	the concept of an <emphasis role="ital">infon</emphasis>,
        a basic unit of
	information [<xref linkend="DEVL92"/>], as a way to represent
	context. One of these systems, BABY-SIT, uses the infon
	directly as a primitive system object to capture the
	definition of a situation, or, in parameterized form, a set of
	possible situations [<xref linkend="TIN94"/>]. The motivation
	for BABY-SIT was to create a system for the development and
	testing of programs based on a situation theory framework
	within the domains of linguistics and artificial intelligence.
      </para><para>
        One of the differences between scope in Topic Maps and infons
        as used by BABY-SIT is that BABY-SIT infons consist of a
        relation, one or more objects corresponding to a role in the
        relationship and a polarity. In this way, they define a
        context (situation) that can be used as a primitive object to
        determine relevance of other relationships and situations
        within the system. While a similar notion could possibly be
        expressed as a Topic Map query, this construct does not seem
        sufficiently rich with which to represent context within a
        specific topic map. However, it could potentially be used as a
        primitive construct within a Topic Map query. It is also not
        clear what implications the introduction of a new context
        representational form may have for existing topic maps.
      </para></section></section><section xml:id="InformationSharing"><title>Information Sharing</title><para>
      The U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) defines
      <emphasis role="ital">information sharing</emphasis> as "'making information
      available to participants (people, processes or systems).'
      Information sharing includes the cultural, managerial and
      technical behaviors by which one participant leverages
      information held or created by another participant" [<xref linkend="DODIS07"/>]. The DoD's specific requirements defined
      by their information sharing strategy also include "the ability
      to transfer information to and obtain information from external
      partners overcoming situations where these partners may have
      disparate processes and capabilities and whose role and nature
      may not be known prior to an event" [<xref linkend="DODIS07"/>]. While the definition and requirements originate with the
      DoD, they serve to provide a basis for more generalized thinking
      on the subject outside the boundaries of the U.S. or the DoD.
    </para><para>
      The promise of knowledge management is to allow an organization
      to employ its collective intelligence to accomplish its
      strategic objectives [<xref linkend="BARQ01"/>]. This
      collective intelligence is a combination of the organization's
      <emphasis role="ital">knowledge</emphasis> and
      <emphasis role="ital">information</emphasis>, where knowledge is
      "understanding gained through experience, observation, or study"
      [<xref linkend="BARQ01"/>] and information is "data that have
      been arranged in meaningful patterns" [<xref linkend="BARQ01"/>]. Knowledge Organization, a method for elaborating knowledge
      structures intended to better facilitate user groups in
      accomplishing their work, and Knowledge Representation, the
      methods used to encode information into knowledge structures,
      are two important aspects of knowledge management where Topic
      Maps is particularly applicable [<xref linkend="PARK03"/>]. Based on examples of use in knowledge management, it would
      seem that the Topic Map standard could also be useful in
      enabling information sharing within any environment with
      requirements similar to the DoD, as the goals of information
      sharing seem to be closely related to the intent of knowledge
      management.
    </para><section xml:id="AProblemOfScaleAndCentralization"><title>A Problem of Scale &amp; Centralization</title><para>
	In attempting to examine how the Topic Maps standard could be
	used to enable information sharing, one of the first questions
	is how best to address the cross-organizational requirements
	inherent in information sharing scenarios. In contrast to most
	knowledge management environments which, by definition, are
	designed to enable an organization to accomplish its own
	strategic objectives, the information sharing environment
	extends outside organizational boundaries and interfaces with
	external partners in a dynamic manner. The phrase "from
	external partners...whose role and nature may not be known
	prior to an event" in the DoD definition is extremely
	important, because it implies that an organization may not
	know with whom it will be needing to exchange information
	before it needs it. In this type of environment, it is not
	possible to operate a static system under centralized control.
      </para><para>
	Unfortunately, most implementations of the Topic Maps standard
	use it, or XTM, as a means for information exchange between
	proprietary systems that are relatively monolithic and
	centralized in nature. Information exchanged, using particular
	topic maps, is integrated into the proprietary system, and
	that information is accessed either via proprietary APIs,
	languages or tools that are not generally directly
	interoperable with other topic map implementations. It is
	worth mentioning the TMAPI effort [<xref linkend="TMAPI"/>]
	in this respect, however since it is an API, it is specific to
	the implementation language - in this case Java - and while it
	will provide portability across compliant applications, it
	does not provide interoperability with other compliant
	applications (see [<xref linkend="TOWN05"/>] for a more
	technical discussion of the differences between
	interoperability and portability, specifically relating to
	reliable messaging).
      </para><para>
	The problems with this scenario are that in order to allow a
	user or application to interact with a topic map, that topic
	map must be managed by the implementation's software, and it
	can only be used by that implementation's tools. Most Topic
	Maps tools are designed to be part of a closed system provided
	by a single source, and assume that management of all topic
	map information will be ultimately centralized. Not
	surprisingly, this approach introduces some potential issues
	relating to scalability and data ownership in an information
	sharing scenario as, according to Annex F.5 of the XTM
	specification, every topic and association in any remotely
	referenced topic map is added to the local topic map,
	triggering additional merging and duplicate suppression [<xref linkend="XTM"/>].
      </para><para>
	In many ways, Topic Maps implementations share characteristics
	of hypermedia systems of the 1980's in that they are closed
	environments, and they ultimately assume ownership of the
	content they manage. This issue was one of the main reasons
	cited by Berners-Lee in writing the software that led to the
	birth of the World-Wide Web [<xref linkend="WRIG01"/>]. It
	would seem that the same issues could prevent Topic Maps from
	directly addressing the large-scale information sharing
	problem - even across a small number of organizations, let
	alone on the scale of the Internet.
      </para><para>
	In an information sharing scenario, decentralized control over
	the information is a necessity. Information exchange between
	two organizations will mean that both organizations will need
	to have a shared representation of that information at a
	specific point in time, but that representation must
	ultimately remain under the control of the originating
	organization. It cannot be subsumed into a merged topic map as
	an understanding of the way the world is. It can only be
	understood by the consumers of that information that it was
	valid when it was accessed, and it may not express the same
	information if accessed again. This highly decentralized model
	is already present in the World-Wide Web, and is "a key aspect
	of the Web's success" [<xref linkend="BERN06"/>].
      </para><para>
	Clearly, one of the other key aspects of the Web's success is
	the underlying architecture, <emphasis role="ital">Representational State
	Transfer</emphasis> (REST), which is designed to support
	operation and deployment on Internet-scale. Specifically, this
	includes the ideas of <emphasis role="ital">anarchic
	scalability</emphasis>, to address the needs for the
	architecture to continue operating under unanticipated load
	and malformed or maliciously constructed data, and
	<emphasis role="ital">independent deployment</emphasis> to facilitate
	"gradual and fragmented change" as the underlying hardware and
	software architectures evolve [<xref linkend="FIEL00"/>]. Much of these capabilities are achieved through the open
	standardization of HTTP, HTML and the URI
	specifications. Without such a stable foundational core, the
	Web would not be able to support independent evolution, and
	interoperability between software and hardware platforms we
	often take for granted today.
      </para><para>
	Such a stable platform for interoperability does not yet exist
	for topic maps. However, many lessons from the Web could
	likely be successfully applied to the existing specifications
	in order to allow them to meet the needs of large-scale
	information sharing, including better cross-domain navigation, explicit information asset ownership,
	managed access control of those information assets, building netwroks and communities of interest.
	Such an environment could potentially
	create "Topic Webs" within a global information space using
	hypermedia constructs that were the aggregate of information
	sources supplied by many different organizations and
	leveraging the highly decentralized model so successful in the
	Web. Thus, navigation within the map would be handled
	uniformly through the use of hypermedia links and standardized
	XML vocabularies leveraging the underlying transfer protocols
	such as HTTP or its potentially forthcoming successor,
	Waka<footnote xml:id="fn6"><para>The initial ideas for the
	protocol were presented at ApacheCon 2002 by Roy Fielding. The
	slides of the presentation are available from:
	http://gbiv.com/protocols/waka/200211_fielding_apachecon.ppt. There
	is also a page on Wikipedia:
	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waka_(protocol).</para></footnote>
	and the views of any given map would be controlled by its
	publisher, based on the user's context of access, including
	the topic map's authorization and identity assertions.
      </para></section><section xml:id="RevisitingTheContextProblem"><title>Revisiting the Context Problem</title><para>
	When extending the Topic Maps model to information sharing
	scenarios, adequate capture and representation of context
	becomes even more important. Not only will the overall
	information space be much more volatile, the potential
	cultural and sociological backgrounds of those using the topic
	maps are likely to be much more diverse than many Topic Maps
	applications today.
      </para><para>
	In an information sharing scenario, there are at least three
	different types of context that will be involved in any
	interaction. Three types of context are present in any
	interaction with a particular topic map, and it will be even
	more important to explicitly capture these in
	information-sharing scenarios. They are:
	<itemizedlist><listitem><para>The context in which the instance was authored,</para></listitem><listitem><para>The context in which the instance is published, and</para></listitem><listitem><para>The context in which the instance is accessed.</para></listitem></itemizedlist>
      </para><para>
	This could be achieved by ensuring that the specific
	context, as represented in Topic Maps by a "scope bundle", can itself
	be reified as a distinct subject and thus be represented as a distinct topic.
	The Topic Maps Reference Model [<xref linkend="TMRM"/>]
	certainly points in this direction. Such an approach however
	brings with it potentially enormous scalability issues, given the number
	and complexity of such scope bundles and the additional danger of possible
	recursive contextualization.
	</para><para>
	In each of the above three steps, authoring, publishing and
	access, there is the potential for misinterpretation of the
	relationships within the topic map, because each relationship
	represents a potential loss of some of the implicit context
	which contributed to the topic map. However, as the audience gets wider
	a counter phenomenon is likely to kick in and help regain some
	balance - that of the "wisdom of crowds": or more precisely, the
	wisdom of groups, as it is more likely to be groups
	of users with similar - dare we suggest - contexts, who will share
	their take on the intended context.
      </para><para>
	Any of the potential usability and manageability problems
	inherent in encoding context information into a topic map in
	the local model will be magnified many times in an information
	space "whose size can be measured in thousands of terabytes,
	and the numbers of users in the hundreds of millions" [<xref linkend="BERN06"/>]. Therefore, there needs to be a mechanism
	where, while the necessary contextual information will be
	available, it should only be referenced as needed. Shared
	contexts between individuals and organizations must therefore
	be represented explicitly. The real meaning of "changing" a
	context (adding or removing references to situations, objects,
	information or any subjective views) needs to be determined
	with sufficient clarity so that the resulting large-scale
	information space represents an improvement on the current Web
	when attempting to find relevant information.
      </para></section><section xml:id="CommercialOpportunitiesAndPotentialArchitectures"><title>Commercial Opportunities and Potential Architectures</title><para>
	A highly distributed model for Topic Maps would require
	similar core, slow-evolving protocols and specifications
	similar to HTTP, URI and HTML. However, there would be few
	restrictions on the speed of evolution in both the content and
	the software implementing those specifications.
      </para><para>
	The main idea is to separate as much as possible the
	monolithic view currently present in Topic Maps platforms into
	the essentials, so that they could evolve independently and
	provide a more dynamic market for more focused products. It is
	not hard to envisage multiple Topic Maps engine vendors
	specializing in particular aspects of performance,
	scalability, availability and management and maybe specialization
	around certain user communities. Likewise, authoring
	and navigation environments would be decoupled from a
	particular Topic Maps engine, allowing for the market to be
	developed. Such environments could also address more potential
	niches in the market through more vendors providing
	solutions. An increase in technology implementations and
	proven interoperability between them should lead to increased
	adoption of the technology and in a much larger way than has
	currently happened with the existing, monolithic approach.
      </para><para>
	Leveraging the capabilities of hypermedia and potentially even
	some of the existing XML vocabularies intended to support
	interaction such as XForms or XHTML, would mean that clients
	would not be dependent on proprietary HTTP or SOAP-based APIs
	in order to author and navigate topic maps. There are many
	opportunities to leverage the "self-descriptive" and
	extensible nature of existing XML vocabularies to allow
	hypermedia documents to completely describe the interaction
	with a Topic Maps implementation.
      </para><para>
	Additionally, unlike the Web, such a system designed to
	support large-scale information sharing would need to be
	designed with a way to represent the legitimacy principles and
	requirements specified by each content provider. Legitimacy is
	the context defining what is considered "fair" behaviour
	within a community or other common environment
	[<xref linkend="WHIT03"/>, <xref linkend="TOWN06"/>].
	This notion of fairness can also be expressed in many
	ways, but in a Topic Maps environment, it would be a good
	candidate for representation using the context mechanisms
	described above, and requiring that agents provide compliant
	implementations of those enforcement mechanisms. Many of the
	presented ideas align very well with the ideas expressed in
	the discussion paper on a "Personal Data Services Model"
	[<xref linkend="BROW06"/>].
      </para></section></section><section xml:id="summary_and_next_steps"><title>Summary and Next Steps</title><para>
      In this paper we addressed questions and thoughts related to
      context and large-scale information sharing through Topic Maps.
    </para><para>
      <emphasis role="ital">Context</emphasis> is critical to effective
      communication, and therefore critical to creating effective
      topic maps. Depending on the role to which topic maps are
      assigned, two differing interpretations on context are
      considered to be sensible:
      <orderedlist><listitem><para>a subjective interpretation of context is
	sensible when users are engaged as active participants that
	study topic maps for a greater understanding of a given
	domain.</para></listitem><listitem><para>an objective interpretation of context is
	useful when topics maps are used to capture and provide
	information that supports ad-hoc queries aiming for a broader
	view of a given domain.</para></listitem></orderedlist>
    </para><para>
      Based on examples of usage in knowledge management, the Topic
      Maps standard is an effective means for information sharing. The
      requirements of <emphasis role="ital">information sharing</emphasis> would
      exclude closed systems under centralized control but rather
      promote a decentralized model, as present in the current World
      Wide Web. However most of the current implementations of the
      Topic Maps standard are proprietary systems running under a
      centralized model. Many Web paradigms can be successfully
      applied to existing Topic Maps implementations in order to meet
      the requirements of large-scale information sharing. Hence
      although Topic Maps is not able to address large-scale
      information sharing directly, it might viably become a standard
      for information sharing if WWW paradigms are embraced,
      potentially creating "Topic Webs".
    </para><para>
      The <emphasis role="ital">relation between context and information
      sharing</emphasis> was demonstrated through the conclusion that
      if information sharing ought to be addressed through topic maps,
      the adequate capture and representation of context is even more
      important as not only is the overall information space much more
      volatile but also the cultural background of users is likely to
      be much more diverse.
    </para><para>
      Furthermore, Topic Maps has <emphasis role="ital">commercial
      opportunities</emphasis> in the area of information sharing if
      implementations become less monolithic and evolve more
      independently in order to increase deployment and
      interoperability through e.g. specialized products and aroud communities of use.
	This is at least the promise of the Topic Maps Reference Model, that
	anticipates that standards bodies will create Topic Map Applications (TMA) organized
	around the needs of such communities: "The disclosure of the ontological
	choices made in those TMAs will enable users across diverse
	communities to effectively marshal information about subjects
	indicated differently in diverse communities"
	[<xref linkend="TMRM"/>].
    </para><para>
      It is possible that parts of the Topic Maps specifications need
      to be enhanced in order for the standard to be used in
      large-scale information sharing, or when attempting to capture
      appropriate contextual information. Much of the presented
      materials are only ideas and theories that need to be explored
      and tested much more rigorously to determine their validity and
      potential applicability to the target domains, bearing in mind
      "the only principle of the scientific method is that experience
      and observation is the sole and ultimate truth of an idea"
      [<xref linkend="FEYN05"/>].
