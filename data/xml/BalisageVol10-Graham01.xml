both transformation and formatting.  The transformation part was
broken out as XSLT long before XSL 1.1 became a Recommendation, so the XSLT spec, bar a few paragaphs about XSLT, is concerned with formatting the result of a XSLT transformation, where:</para><blockquote><para>Formatting is enabled by including formatting semantics in the result tree. Formatting semantics are expressed in terms of a catalog of classes of formatting objects. The nodes of the result tree are formatting objects. The classes of formatting objects denote typographic abstractions such as page, paragraph, table, and so forth. Finer control over the presentation of these abstractions is provided by a set of formatting properties, such as those controlling indents, word- and letter spacing, and widow, orphan, and hyphenation control. In XSL, the classes of formatting objects and formatting properties provide the vocabulary for expressing presentation intent.</para></blockquote><para>Figure 1 is the detailed conceptual model diagram from XSL 1.1.  It shows a linear process from XML source to the result of the XSLT stage to the formatted output.</para><figure xml:id="model1"><title>XSL 1.1 processing model</title><mediaobject><imageobject><imagedata format="png" fileref="../../../vol10/graphics/Graham01/Graham01-001.png"/></imageobject></mediaobject></figure><para>The process of turning XML in the FO vocabulary into formatted, and more than likely paginated, output is itself defined in multiple stages.  Figure 2, also from XSL 1.1, shows how the XML representation of the formatting objects is turned into actual objects (as 'actual' as bits and bytes in computer memory can be), expressions in property values are resolved, and the formatter then makes areas.  The formatted areas could be written out to a graphical or document format (such as PDF, PostScript, or RTF) or, in some cases, could be written out as an XML representation of the area tree for later processing.</para><figure xml:id="model2"><title>Summary of the process</title><mediaobject><imageobject><imagedata format="png" fileref="../../../vol10/graphics/Graham01/Graham01-002.png"/></imageobject></mediaobject></figure><para>The XSL spec itself notes that its design follows that of DSSSL [DSSSL]:</para><blockquote><para>XSL builds on the prior work on Cascading Style Sheets [CSS2] and the Document Style Semantics and Specification Language [DSSSL].</para></blockquote><para>and the linear processing model with transformation and formatting stages follows that of DSSSL:</para><figure xml:id="dsssl1"><title>DSSSL processing model</title><mediaobject><imageobject><imagedata format="png" fileref="../../../vol10/graphics/Graham01/Graham01-003.png"/></imageobject></mediaobject></figure><figure xml:id="dsssl2"><title>DSSSL formatting</title><mediaobject><imageobject><imagedata format="png" fileref="../../../vol10/graphics/Graham01/Graham01-004.png"/></imageobject></mediaobject></figure><para>DSSSL goes one step further - or XSL took one step back from DSSSL - since DSSSL states:</para><blockquote><para>DSSSL is independent of the type of formatter,

Figures may be either column-wide or page-wide, and tables may be column-wide, page-wide, or rotated so their width is page-high, but there is no size information for either figures or tables in the source XML.  Figures and graphics may also float to either the top or bottom of the page or column.</para><section><title>XSL 1.1 capabilities</title><para>XSL 1.1 defines a 'before-float-reference-area' on a page, but does not define an area for content floated to the 'after' end of the page, and the 'before-float-reference-area', when instantiated, takes the full width of the fo:region-body of the page.</para><para>PLOS therefore had to choose a XSL formatter based on the availability of vendor extensions to support more ways to float than defined by XSL 1.1.</para></section><section><title>Graphics handling</title><para>Graphics at least have an intrinsic size and, in formats such as TIFF, have an intrinsic resolution as well.</para><para>The process for determining whether graphics are column-wide or page-wide is:</para><itemizedlist><listitem><para>Download copies of TIFF images from PLOS ONE article web page</para><para>In production, PLOS will have the graphics available on their servers, so this is only ncessary while developing the stylesheet.</para></listitem><listitem><para>Run ImageMagick 'identify' on each graphic to get its width, height, horizontal resolution, and vertical resolution and write the information to a '.identify' file for each graphic</para></listitem><listitem><para>In the XSLT stylesheet, when processing a graphic, get the contents of the corresponding '.identify' file using 'unparsed-text()', tokenize the returned string to get the four values, then calculate the graphic's width by dividing the width in pixels by the horizontal resolution.

XSL doesn't allow floated FOs to break across a page, so imilarly to as described below for tables, the processing system 'preformats' the figure captions at both widths and writes out the area tree to be used as input by the main stylesheeet so the stylesheet reduces the allowed maximum height of the graphic so the graphic won't push its following caption into the footer area.</para></section><section><title>Table handling</title><para>Tables, as noted above, are presented one of three ways -- column-wide, page-wide, or page-high -- depending on which best fits the content of the table.  Deciding which to do is entirely up to the processing system since the source XML, converted from other sources as it was, does not include even the few presentation-oriented attributes defined by the DTD.</para><para>The NLM/JATS DTDs support [TableWrap] specifying the orientation of a combined table and caption but do not provide a way to indicate the width of a table.  The NISO JATS table model does allow a 'style' attribute on 'table' and 'caption', but not on the 'table-wrap' that contains them both.</para><para>The sample files provided at the start of the project included TIFF images of each of the tables in the samples as well as TIFF files for the graphics, and it wasn't until the project was underway that it was made clear that the images of the tables were artifacts of the existing processing system and, not only were they not going to be available for new documents, the new system was expected to produce those as well.</para><para>The implemented approach makes a temporary 'sizer' formatted document containing each table at each width, saves the area tree from that document, and provides the area tree as a parameter to the stylesheet that produces the FO for the final formatted output.</para><para>The 'sizer' document comprises three pages that each have a different fixed width and a large height (since the formatter doesn't support '&lt;fo:root media-usage="bounded-in-one-dimension"&gt;').  Every table in the source XML has an ID, so the tables on each page are given a unique ID in their FO document by prefixing a page-specific prefix to the tables original ID.  The following figure shows tables from an article formatted at page-wide, column-wide, and page-high widths.

In response to comments on the mailing list, Arved Sandstrom of MagicLamp Software produced a proof-of-concept extension function [FOPRunXSLTExt] for both the Saxon and Xerces XSLT processors that, mid-transform, runs the Apache FOP XSL formatter [FOP] on a provided FO document and returns (a reference to) the area tree XML for the formatted result.</para><para>Several examples of the extension function in action are provided on the PPL wiki.

If it is to be generally usable and usable with different XSL formatters, there should be a common area tree XML format into which vendor's area trees can be transformed and/or library functions for common area tree access operations.</para></section><section><title>Adapt Saxon-CE event model to XSL-FO?</title><para>Using the proof-of-concept extension function, an
XSLT stylesheet can now make decisions about what to put in the result
based on the trial formatted size of areas, but as it's only a
proof-of-concept, it doesn't aim as high as getting feedback from or
modifying in-situ the area tree for the final, formatted document.</para><para>Once people have tried a few things with getting feedback from the XSL
formatter and start asking their vendors for the same or better, they'll
also be wanting an interoperable way to express what to do with that
feedback.  For simple feedback of static area trees, which is all that is
possible with the current proof-of-concept, the most interoperability that
you could manage would be a common representation of area trees (with
flexibility for vendor extensions) and, possibly, a library of XSLT
functions to make it easier to navigate the area trees, but for "live"
feedback, something more would be required.</para><para>The PPL CG has recently been looking at how Saxon-CE [SaxonCE] handles user input, and considering whether the same sort of pattern could be adapted to handling
feedback from the XSL formatter.  Saxon-CE does it through template
rules that match the element that receives the event and are in a mode
that reflects the type of event, and similarly an XSL formatter could
trigger on exceptional events such as overflow occurring or even on
mundane events such as completion of a page sequence, and the templates in
the corresponding modes could match on either FOs in the FO tree or areas
in the area tree.</para><para>The following template from the "Knight's Tour" sample Saxon-CE
application is the event handler for when the user clicks the 'Reset'
button.  It simply writes a NO-BREAK SPACE to each square on the Knight's

  &lt;/xsl:for-each&gt;
&lt;/xsl:template&gt;</programlisting><para>The key feature of the event handler for the purposes of this discussion
is that it's written in plain old XSLT.  The advantage of the XSLT event
handler for Saxon-CE users is interactivity "without dropping down into
JavaScript" (as the Saxon-CE documentation so delicately puts it),
but the advantage for XSL-FO users would simply be that they don't need to
learn a new language (declarative, functional, or otherwise) to handle
feedback.  (And the advantage for those trying to define or
implement feedback is that they don't need to invent a whole new language to
handle it.)</para><para>Applying the Saxon-CE approach to XSL-FO, the following conceptual FO

An extra wrinkle for XSL-FO is the question of whether event handlers
should be specified to (a) match on, and (b) modify the FO tree or the
area tree or both.  There are some existing requirements that can only be
satisfied by modifying the area tree, e.g., Section 3.3, Output result of
expression:</para><blockquote><para>Allow users to output the result of expressions on area tree,
   traits, markers or text content. For example to calculate the
   subtotal of a certain page (as opposed to a running total that
   is already supported in XSL 1.1 with table markers)</para></blockquote><para>On the other hand, it will often be simpler (from the user's perspective)
to modify an FO rather than all the areas that it generates, since a
single FO may generate multiple areas across several columns or pages (and
footnote areas), and its content may be reused in markers on multiple
pages.  If, for example, the response to a page sequence taking too many
pages is to reduce the font size in one of the multiple flows appearing on
the page, it would be at once simple to adjust the 'font-size' property on
the appropriate FOs in the FO tree and inaccurate to directly modify font
sizes in the line areas in the area tree.  If the XSL formatter did the
work based on modified FOs, it would reflow the line areas based on their
reduced font size and make the pages again and the resulting modified
block areas would break across pages in different places because of the
smaller font size.  If the XSLT stylesheet did the work by modifying the
area tree, it would have to do the same recalculating of text sizes and
the same merging or splitting of line areas and of block areas, and all
(probably) without the benefit of font metrics.  It might work, just, in a
simple case with only monospace fonts, but would still be a lot of work to
do in XSLT.</para><para>Adapting the Saxon-CE event model to XSL-FO is, therefore, an interesting
possible solution to handling feedback from the XSL formatter, but there
are still many FO-specific details that would have to be worked out.</para></section></section><section><title>Conclusion</title><para>The linear processing model of XSL 1.1 has served it will -- and, in the XSL 1.0 timeframe, helped it towards becoming a Recommendation -- but real world use cases have forced users into doing multi-pass processing and other tricks so they can make decisions on what to put in the formatted output based on sizes in the formatted output.  The XSL-FO 2.0 requirements document recognised some of these requirements, but the XPPL WG's charter expired without XSL-FO 2.0 being completed.  Since then, the Print and Page Layout Community Group at the W3C has been producing innovative ideas and solutions to help satisfy the user requirements for more decision making in XSL-FO processing.</para></section><bibliography><title>Bibliography</title><bibliomixed xml:id="CustReq" xreflabel="CustReq">Frequently and less frequently stated requirements by print customers, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="new" xlink:actuate="onRequest">http://www.w3.org/community/ppl/wiki/CustomerRequirements</link></bibliomixed><bibliomixed xml:id="DSSSL" xreflabel="DSSSL">ISO/IEC 10179:1996 Information technology - Processing languages - Document Style Semantics and Specification Language (DSSSL),
