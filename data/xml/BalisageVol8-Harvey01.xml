            Technical Manuals (IETM) in the early 70’s.  The first initiative was the “Paperless
            Ship” initiative.  The original idea behind the Paperless Ship initiative was to
            digitize all paper manuals and provide them in electronic form.  The first initiative
            took paper manuals, scanned and created microfiche images from the pages of the
            manuals.  Every ship was provided microfiche readers.  Many of the microfiche images
            were very poor quality. Scanning documents was new technology at the time and not
            perfected.  </para><para>In practice, most technicians printed the relevant pages from the manuals they were
            interested in. After all the relevant pages were printed, the microfiche readers became
            big paperweights and gaithered dust.  It wasn’t feasible for technicians to take the
            microfiche readers to their maintenance areas or fit a microfiche reader to their bunk
            to study. So much for microfiche!</para><para>The next phase of the Paperless Ship initiative was electronically indexed page images
            which began in the early 80’s.  Maintenance manuals were digitized into TIFF graphics. 
            Indices were created in the background which allowed readers to search and navigate to
            the point in the graphical representation of the document.  This obviously was a vast
            improvement over microfiche.  The original Navy Advanced Technical Information Support
            (ATIS) program was a fairly successful initiative.</para><para>The Computer Aided Logistic Support (CALS)  initiative began in 1985.  In later years
            the CALS acronym morphed into "Continuous Acquisition and Lifecycle Support" and finally
            "Commerce at Light Speed". The CALS initiative resulted in numerous military
            specifications for graphics, publishing, integrated database and IETMs.  Tri-Service
            working groups were created which consisted of Army, Navy and Air Force representatives,
            as well as government contractors and interested software vendors.  These working groups
            cooperated to create joint specifications which were designed to be used by all U.S. DoD
            organizations.  These specifications were also used as contractual requirements for DoD
            logistics suppliers.  </para></section><section><title>DoD SGML Publishing and Specifications</title><para>The specification <link xlink:href="http://www.navsea.navy.mil/nswc/carderock/tecinfsys/sgm/sgm-std/doc/28001c.pdf" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="new" xlink:actuate="onRequest">MIL-PRF-28001</link> (MARKUP REQUIREMENTS AND GENERIC STYLE SPECIFICATION FOR
            EXCHANGE OF TEXT AND ITS PRESENTATION) was originally published in 1992.  The last
            printing was MIL-PRF-280001C which was published in 1997.  MIL-PRF-28001 specified the
            use of SGML for all new technical manuals within DoD.  Each branch of the service
            developed DTD’s for use within their individual organizations based on their specific
            requirements and adhering to the requirements in MIL-PRF-28001.  </para><para>In addition to specifying the SGML constructs for developing DTD’s, MIL-PRF-28001
            provided a DTD and specification for applying styling to the SGML.  The styling
            specification was called Formatting Output Specification Instance (FOSI).  Appendix B of
            the specification contained the DTD that supported the use of FOSI for presentation. 
            Several SGML vendors were part of the working group and were working toward developing a
            FOSI-based publishing system.  Two vendors DataLogic and Arbortext successfully
            developed FOSI-based formatting within their product.  However, the implementation was
            slightly different in both systems based on different interpretations of the
            specification and ambiguity of the DTD.  The result was that a FOSI developed for one
            system could not be used in other systems.</para><para>About the time the FOSI was being finalized, the JCALS (Joint Computer Aided
            Logistics) program began which implemented an integrated publishing system for the
            components of CALS integrated into the hardware/software platform. JCALS included SGML
            authoring, editing and publication components.   Arbortext was the editor and DataLogic
            performed the publishing in JCALS.  The system was available and started being used and
            mandated for technical publications in the 1994/1995 timeframe.</para></section><section><title>IETM Specifications</title><para>The CALS initiative had three IETM specifications.</para><itemizedlist><listitem><para>MIL-PRF-87268 - General Content, Style, Format and User Interface

            presentation was very simplistic.  Window-based systems were in their infancy and the

            were custom developed and were costly.  Getting data to valid MIL-PRF-87269 SGML was
            very expensive.  In 1995 the estimate for authoring or converting data was $100 a page. 
            Once the data was in an 87269 SGML format it was very difficult to produce written pages
            because of the fault isolation and navigation linking that took place.</para><para>Small programs and component manufacturers could not economically afford such an
            expensive endeavor.  If and organization could afford getting the data into a compliant
            87269 format,  obtaining knowledgeable personnel was difficult to find.  Most
            knowledgable individuals were employed by the large defense contractors and smaller
            companies could not compete at that level.</para><para>DoD and the Navy in particular realized that a ‘one-size fits all’ approach to IETM’s

            Some contracts still stipulate that the documents have to be published using the FOSI’s
            that were developed for the JCALS systems.  JCALS software and the hardware that
            supports it is no longer available.  JCALS ran on Sun Microsystems platform.  The
            software components were tightly integrated.  </para><para>Companies who have had long-standing contracts (5 years or more) with DoD to supply
            manuals in whatever format that was specified, i.e., Word, WordPerfect, etc. are
            receiving new contracts that have contractual language requiring SGML and published PDF
            using JCALS FOSI's.  Most of these organizations have never heard of SGML or FOSI's.
            The documentation part of the contract is a small component of their
            deliverables.</para><para>This was case the for Cobham.  They  Air Force modified the documentation portion of
            their contract to deliver technical manuals in SGML conforming to MIL-STD-38784C or
            MIL-PRF-87269.  Initially there was a stipulation that a PDF for each manual be
            delivered using the JCALS FOSI (DataLogic).   These requirements are impossible for them
            to achieve, especially with MIL-PRF-87269.  During the initial phase of the requirement
            by the Air Force to move to SGML, Cobham management and staff received an education in
            SGML and surrounding technologies. SGML, FOSI, and XML. This was brand new territory for
            them.   In order to understand the nuances of the requirements of the contract they
            needed to be made aware of the realities of modern-day SGML publishing and it's
            challenges and limitations, i.e., the lack of available software.  Through negotiation
            the Air Force agreed to the following deliverables:</para><orderedlist><listitem><para> SGML Manuals</para></listitem><listitem><para>TIFF graphics</para></listitem><listitem><para>Class 3 IETM</para></listitem></orderedlist></section><section><title>Solution</title><para>The first step was to educate the staff in SGML authoring and  MIL-STD-38784C in

                SVN was critical during the training process for Cobham SME's.  It also provided
                Cobham the ability to remotely test the development of the IETM and provide
                real-time feedback.  An SVN repository was established on a Linux (CENTOS) box that

                written to initially convert the Microsoft Word manuals to MIL-STD-38784C.  The
                manuals that Cobham had written were very well formatted so the conversion was
                better than most Word to XML conversions.  Cobham authors were consistent in the use
                of styles within the Word file.  Consistency in use of styles within a desktop
                editor file makes conversion to XML much easier and provides a better end
                product.</para><para>The initial conversion was to XML because XSLT only works on XML. Another option
                would have been to use Omnimark and go directly to SGML but there are more XSLT
                developers then Omnimark developers and if modifications were required any XSLT
                developer could make the modifications.   Arbotext Editor supports both SGML and XML
                so the obvious choice was XML.  The data was ‘saved as’ SGML after the final edits
                were made to the manual and it was ready to be delivered.  The SGML version of the
                file is the official deliverable.  The XML version is used to create the IETM
                version.</para><para>There were some manual edits that were required after the Word to XML conversion. 
                These edits required some reorganization of text. Most military technical manual
                specifications are designed to be very hierarchical and are very stringent in the
                organization of content.</para><para>Some of the areas that needed to be reorganized or rewritten by a subject-matter

                        was required to evaluate the text and determine the best approach for making
                        the SGML valid according to the DTD and not affect the functionality of the

                        appear in the “Warning, Caution, Notes” sequence.  The Word manuals followed
                        this construct for warnings and cautions, however, notes occasionally were
                        located after paragraphs.  The conversion tried to capture these occurrences
                        but wasn’t 100% successful because it required evaluating text to determine

            staff was involved in each step of the development.  They provided feedback and guidance
            on the look and feel of the IETM throughout each iteration.  Creating HTML from the XML
            version of the manuals was relatively straight-forward, however, decisions had to be
            made about the necessary functionality and look-and-feel.   MIL-STD-38784C was developed
            with paper or PDF output in mind.  It is not a true IETM specification.  The following
            decisions were required:</para><orderedlist><listitem><para>1.       Navigation from components</para></listitem><listitem><para>2.       Level of granularity of text (chunking)</para></listitem><listitem><para>3.       Specialty sections, i.e., List of Tables.</para></listitem><listitem><para>4.       Handling graphics</para></listitem></orderedlist><para><emphasis role="bold">Navigation From Components</emphasis></para><para>We decided to use a framed-approach for the IETM.  A navigation panel is on the left-side
            of the screen.  The user can navigate using a hierarchical table of contents.  We also
            added widgets for expanding and collapsing navigation hierarchy.  We also added a button
            for searching the entire contents.  Below is the start page of the sample IETM.</para><mediaobject><imageobject><imagedata fileref="../../../vol8/graphics/Harvey01/Harvey01-003.jpg" format="jpg"/></imageobject></mediaobject><para><emphasis role="bold">Search Engine</emphasis></para><para>We selected a very inexpensive search engine called Zoom from Wrensoft. Zoom will index
            directories and subdirectories.  It is highly configurable and had all the functionality
            required to be able to search and navigate to appropriate locations in the IETM. The
            search engine can be used to create indexes of websites or documents for CD.  Currently
            each manual is indexed separately however, if a family of manuals were included the
            search engine index session the product could index more than a single manual.  The
            process for creating the index is manual and is performed by Cobham SME's after the book
            has completed the editorial process and the IETM has been generated and is ready to be
            delivered.</para><para>Zoom creates 5 files that get included into the root directory where the indexed files. 
            The conversion of  XSLT scripts create the interface that enables the search
            functionality during conversion from XML to HTML.</para><mediaobject><imageobject><imagedata fileref="../../../vol8/graphics/Harvey01/Harvey01-004.jpg" format="jpg"/></imageobject></mediaobject><para><emphasis role="bold">Graphics</emphasis></para><para>Graphics we problematic.  Figures in a MIL-STD-38784C paper manual are full-page
            graphics.  Large, highly detailed graphics do not scale well in a viewing pane. During
            initial design we provided the graphics in-line but they really weren't acceptable
            because of the sheer size of the graphics. We solved this problem by providing links in
            the IETM to the graphic.  A PDF file was created for every figure in the manual using
            XSL-FO.  A  XSL-FO (.fo) file is created int he graphics directory for each graphic in
            the manual.  The XSLT creates a separate Windows batch file that get run separately to
            call RenderX and create the PDF file of the graphic.  The PDF file contained the figure
            number, the title of the figure and the graphic itself.  All the graphics in the manual
            are currently in TIFF formatted files.</para><para><emphasis role="bold">SVG Graphics</emphasis></para><para>We did a proof of concept for creating SVG.   We tested putting warnings, cautions and
        notes into a presentation defined in GCSFUI.  The challenge was ensuring that the  text not
        overflow the boundary of the box.</para><para>SVG Generated Warning from XSLT (NOTE:  Text replaced - actual graphic will be used once
        non-proprietary data is converted)</para><mediaobject><imageobject><imagedata fileref="../../../vol8/graphics/Harvey01/Harvey01-005.jpg" width="132"/></imageobject></mediaobject><para>We also tested putting overlays on the on the bitmapped graphics.  We successfully created
                <emphasis role="ital">hotspots</emphasis> on the graphics themselves and linked them
            bi-directionally to and from the IPB to the PDF graphic.  This functionality is very
            easy to obtain during the conversion by using id/idref functionality.  The time
            consuming part of this approach was having manpower to manually create the hotspots.
            This can be very time consuming when there are hundreds of call-outs in a graphic. There
            were no requirements for graphic hotspots so this functionality was put on the back
            burner.</para><para>None of the SVG graphics were used in the final product but we did prove that it could
            be done and if the hotspots were available in the graphic during development of the
            product it is relatively easy to accomplish. </para><section><title>On-site (Cobham) Production of ETM</title><para>After the first few manuals Cobham was off and running on their own.  They were
                authoring new manuals to MIL-STD-38784 and creating the ETM version based on the

                don't require support.</para></section></section><section><title>Conclusion</title><para>This project was very successful.  The Air Force was happy with the deliverables. 
            Cobham was able to deliver a quality product to the Air Force.  The challenge is still
            obtaining necessary technical editors who are knowledgeable about SGML (and XML).
            Whenever there is a turnover in personnel new people need to either have an SGML/XML
            background or be trained in the technology.  </para><para>This project could not have been as successful without the vision of Cobham and their
            dedication to producing a quality product.  The military SGML specifications are
