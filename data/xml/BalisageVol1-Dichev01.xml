sharing and integrating data across RDF and
        Topic Map representations. The novel
aspect of tackling the RDF - Topic Maps
interoperability
        problem is the attempt to identify the
right balance between the following key aspects:
        (i) semantics-preserving data translation;
(ii) completeness of the translation; (iii)
pragmatics
        and usability of the translation. The
proposed strategy towards achieving this goal is
based on
        exploiting the ontological correspondence
between RDF and Topic Maps.  The design focus is
placed
        on a translation respecting the meaning

        The paper analyzes the feasibility of the
interoperability task, presents some requirements
derived
        from this analysis, and proposes a method
for RDF - Topic Maps translation. The proposed
method is
        implemented as a plug-in of the TM4L topic maps editor.</para></abstract><author><personname><firstname>Christo</firstname><surname>Dichev</surname></personname><personblurb><para/></personblurb><affiliation><orgname>Winston-Salem State University</orgname></affiliation><email>dichevc@wssu.edu</email></author><author><personname><firstname>Darina</firstname><surname>Dicheva</surname></personname><personblurb><para/></personblurb><affiliation><orgname>Winston-Salem State University</orgname></affiliation><email>dichevad@wssu.edu</email></author><author><personname><firstname>Boriana</firstname><surname>Ditcheva</surname></personname><personblurb><para/></personblurb><affiliation><orgname>Winston-Salem State University</orgname></affiliation><email>boriana.ditcheva@gmail.com</email></author><author><personname><firstname>Mike</firstname><surname>Moran</surname></personname><personblurb><para/></personblurb><affiliation><orgname>Winston-Salem State University</orgname></affiliation><email>mmoran106@wssu.edu</email></author><legalnotice><para>Copyright © 2008 Christo Dichev,

major problem given the sheer volume of
information on the web
         and the advances in information retrieval
and indexing technology.  The lack of
interoperability at the
         model, metadata, and data levels presents
the major barrier to knowledge and data sharing
[<xref linkend="ref33"/>].
         Many-to-many data-interchange media, such
as the web, pose new requirements for sharing and
exchange of
         data. One of the most challenging among
them is the ability to make use of information
outside of its
         structural origin. This requirement
implies data interchange not only on a syntactic,
but also on a
         semantic and structural level.  </para><para>The presented work was motivated by
the idea of creating a tool that allows effective
reuse and
        integration of existing Topic Maps (TM)
and RDF data. Similarly to previous efforts in
this direction
        [<xref linkend="ref15"/>], [<xref linkend="ref18"/>], [<xref linkend="ref21"/>],
[<xref linkend="ref3"/>],
        [<xref linkend="ref10"/>], [<xref linkend="ref28"/>], we aim at enhancing the
interoperability between
        the two models by providing
        translation bridging the two frameworks,
instead of forcing applications “to speak the
same language”.
        The aim is similar but the proposed
approach is different.  In previous works, the
mapping strategies
        are guided by the observed equivalence
between the Topic Maps subject and RDF resource
concepts. Such a
        strategy implies some sort of
subject-centered translation. In contrast, our
approach is based on the
        ontological correspondence between RDF and
Topic Maps.  Diverse and interesting similarities
can be
        captured based on correspondences between
the ways we relate things rather than on the
correspondences
        between things alone. Therefore, our
approach implies identifying similarities not
only between concepts,
        but also between how statements about
those concepts are asserted. Such similarities
make the translation
        between the two models more predictable.
This is a principal point in our translation
approach, which
        proposes to divide the concepts to be
translated into overlapping and non-overlapping
categories and
        then to conquer them by translating, with
a correspondingly focused and general
translation.  </para><para>This type of work is related to
ontology and metadata mapping [<xref linkend="ref13"/>],[<xref linkend="ref14"/>],
      [<xref linkend="ref24"/>],[<xref linkend="ref31"/>]. Metadata mapping,
       in particular, involves an identification
of equivalent or nearly equivalent metadata
elements within
       different metadata schemas. In contrast to
metadata mapping, translation between
independently developed
       RDF and Topic Maps data can not be
accomplished by mapping between two vocabularies.
The mapping mechanism
       is more complex because it involves mapping
between frameworks with extensible vocabularies
implying that
       one-to-one correspondence is not generally possible.</para><para>A critical question regarding this type
of translation is whether all concepts of the
source language
       can be appropriately translated to some in
the target language. Assuming that a complete
translation is
       possible, a derived question is whether all
concepts from the source language should be
translated to the
       target language at any price. At first, it
seems that complete and accurate translation from
the source to
       the target language (if possible) should be
preferable to the translation skipping or
transforming the
       meaning of some concepts. However, the
answer, in fact, depends on the purpose of the
translation and on
       the selected criteria. The translation as a
process and objective involves two aspects:
semantic and
       pragmatic [<xref linkend="ref35"/>]. They
correspond to the following questions: Is a
concept from the source language expressible
       in the target language? Is a concept
translated from the source language useful in the
target language? </para><para>The technical and pragmatic aspects of
the translation reflected by the above questions
are equally
       important. They also imply a variable
strategy. Instead of a complete and faithful
translation in some cases
       it might be better to chose a translation
preserving the meaning of some concepts and
modifying (slightly)
       the meaning of some other in order to match
them to predefined concepts in the target
language. The translation
       strategy of the source concepts should not
be independent from their role in the target. For
example, extending
       a language to accommodate a foreign concept
is a challenging task from a usability
perspective. The following
       observations indicate that the set of
concepts satisfying the first question is not
necessarily equivalent to
       the set of concepts satisfying the second one:

translation. In contrast to the previous works on
RDF - Topic Maps
       mapping, preserving the ontological
vocabulary is not a required property of our
translation approach.
       Instead, the basic requirements are guided
by pragmatic and semantic considerations. As a
result, the focus
       is on a translation respecting the meaning,
the utility and the readability of the translated
data.</para><para>This paper addresses the problem of RDF
- Topic Maps interoperability by analyzing the
feasibility of
       this task and identifying some requirements
derived from that analysis.  Based on the results
of the analysis
       we propose a method for RDF - Topic Maps
(RDF2TM) translation. In contrast to metadata
mapping, a general
       RDF2TM mapping goes beyond the simple data
interoperability, since it involves exchange of
conceptual knowledge
       within and across the corresponding Topic
Maps and RDF models. The paper starts with a
conceptual discussion
       of problems in RDF - Topic Maps
interoperability, which motivated the design
requirements of our translation.
       Section 3 discuses the technical details of
the proposed approach, while the implementation
and examples are
       presented in section 4. We summarize the
related works and tools addressing RDF2TM
translation in section 5
       and conclude in section 6.</para></section><section><title>Semantic and Pragmatic Aspects of RDF

a conceptual viewpoint  </title><para> As with natural languages, translating
RDF constructs into corresponding Topic Maps
constructs and
      structures requires interpretation and may
involve some loss or distortion of meaning. The
interoperability
      between RDF and Topic Maps languages has
been addressed by various authors[<xref linkend="ref3"/>],
      [<xref linkend="ref10"/>], [<xref linkend="ref15"/>],[<xref linkend="ref18"/>],[<xref linkend="ref21"/>],
      [<xref linkend="ref21"/>], with
      a focus primarily of the syntactic and
semantic level; less attention has been paid to
the pragmatic and
      practical aspects of the translation. In
contrast to the previous works on RDF2TM mapping,
vocabulary and
      structure preservation is not the top
priority of our translation.  Our basic
requirements are guided by
      pragmatic and semantic considerations. </para><para>We distinguish differences between
ontology languages from differences between the
ontologies themselves.
      The latter can further be divided into
differences among the things that are described
and differences in
      the way things are described. The problems
associated with the semantic interoperability
between RDF and
      Topic Maps are mostly due to the differences
in their original assumption of how the world is
modeled.  These
      differences are passed to the corresponding
modeling frameworks, which directly affects the
syntax and the
      descriptive capability of each. It also
affects the mapping between the two models. The
fact that RDF and
      Topic Maps differ in representation,
structure, and vocabulary leads to a great
multiplicity of matching
      alternatives. In general, an RDF2TM mapping
process can not be defined by one-to-one matching
relationships
      between the source and target concepts.
Typically it involves one-to-many, many-to-one,
and one-to-none
      relationships. This type of matching
ambiguity may turn into semantic inconsistency
that is not resolvable
      without specific domain information.  Such
inconsistencies occur because the source model:
(i) differs in
      compositional granularity from the target,
(ii) has extensible vocabulary along with the
target and
      (iii) contains concepts that are irrelevant
according to the target ontological vocabulary.
</para><para>These observations are critical in the
context of RDF — Topic Maps interoperability.
We can illustrate
      the key points in comparison with
conventional programming languages. First
consider the translation of the
      FORTRAN loop statements </para><programlisting xml:space="preserve">
      DO 10 I = 1, 100
         STATEMENT1
         …..
         STATEMENTn
     10  CONTINUE </programlisting><para>into the following  C++ statement.</para><programlisting xml:space="preserve">
    for(int i = 1; i &lt; 101; i++)
       {
	  statement1
           …..
           statementn

       }</programlisting><para>It is straightforward, because the loop
vocabulary (keywords) is predetermined and it
does not depend
      on the intention of the user.  The FORTRAN
loop statement <emphasis><code> DO 10 I = 1,
100</code></emphasis>
      doesn’t allow variations, e.g.
<emphasis><code>PERFORM 10 I = 1, 100.
</code></emphasis> Similarly, C++ does
      not support extensibility with non standard
control structures and for loop is defined in the
language. Any
      change in the C++ loop vocabulary
<emphasis><code> for(int i = 1; i &lt; 101;
i++)</code></emphasis> e.g.
      into <emphasis><code> trough(int i = 1; i
&lt; 101; i++) </code></emphasis> will violate
the syntax rules.
      This results into  one-to-one matching
between the two loop statements with fixed
semantics.</para><para>Now consider a similar task in our
original context: translating the following Topic
Maps binary
      association  <footnote><para> For single TM
assertions we use notation based on LTM

(http://www.ontopia.net/download/ltm.html</para></footnote>:</para><programlisting xml:space="preserve">

         based-on(lecture7 : adaptation,  Xpointer : source)</programlisting><para>with verbalization: <emphasis role="ital"> Lecture7 is based on the topic
Xpointer</emphasis>, where
      <emphasis role="ital">Lecture7</emphasis>
plays a role of  <emphasis role="ital">adaptation</emphasis> and
      <emphasis role="ital">Xpointer</emphasis>
plays a role of <emphasis role="ital">source</emphasis>.
      Can we translate this association into a
single RDF property</para><programlisting xml:space="preserve">

         ex:lecture7     ext:based-on      ex:Xpointer</programlisting><para>with corresponding verbalization
<emphasis role="ital">Lecture 7 is based on
Xpointer?</emphasis>
      The answer is not obvious at a syntactic
level.  Firstly, the naming (vocabulary) in the
TM association
     </para><programlisting xml:space="preserve">

         based-on(lecture7:adaptation,  Xpointer : source) </programlisting><para>is left to the user’s choice, as
opposed to the first example. For instance, it is
possible to
      assert Topic Map association with different name, e.g.
     </para><programlisting xml:space="preserve">

         derived-from(lecture7:adaptation,  Xpointer : source)</programlisting><para>but with an equivalent meaning to the
first one.  More interestingly, Topic Map
associations differ
      in compositional granularity from the RDF
properties. Their expression involves concepts
such as association
      type and role types coupled with
role-playing topics. The <emphasis role="ital">Role player: Role type</emphasis>
      constructs of the Topic Maps association do
not have a matching counterpart in the RDF
properties (i.e.
      one-to-none matching). In such cases there
are three alternatives: to disregard all role
players in the
      translation, to translate them into a
predefined RDF construct with a similar meaning
or to perform a
      semantic preserving translation into RDF
construct intended to serve as an RDF encoding of
the TM role
      types and role players. Even if we decide to
skip the Topic Maps role types translation, we
still have
      to decide how to relate role players to the
subject and object of the RDF based-on property.
This will
      transform the directionally neutral Topic
Maps association into uni-directional RDF
properties. A closer
      look at Topic Maps association
specifications reveals that both role players
must be topics (they cannot be
      strings) while the object of the RDF
based-on property can be any resource. For
example, in one RDF document
      the object of the ext:based-on property may
refer to a web page describing Xpointer (single
resource)
      while in another RDF document the object of
the ext:based-on property may refer to the
Xpointer concept
      with a reference to book chapter divided
into sections by relevant RDF properties
(structure of resources).
      Thus significant amount of the information
carried by the association </para><programlisting xml:space="preserve">

         based-on(lecture7 : adaptation,   Xpointer : source)</programlisting><para> will be lost if we choose to translate
it directly into the RDF
statement</para><programlisting xml:space="preserve">

         ex:lecture7     ext:based-on      ex:Xpointer</programlisting><para>is In fact such a process will be a
<emphasis role="ital">transformation
</emphasis>of a Topic Maps
      association into an RDF property, since it
is changing the representation as well as the
semantics.
     </para><para>One point that was left implicit in the
above example is that a complete semantic mapping
is not
      always the best alternative. For example, if
the <emphasis role="ital">Superclass-Subclass</emphasis>
      association</para><programlisting xml:space="preserve">

         Superclass-Subclass(Person: superclass,
Professor: subclass)</programlisting><para>  is mapped directly to the RDF(S)
subClassOf property:</para><programlisting xml:space="preserve">

         ex:Professor   rdfs:subClassOf  ex:Person</programlisting><para>where the player of type <emphasis role="ital">superclass</emphasis> is mapped to
the object and the player
      of  type <emphasis role="ital">subclass</emphasis> is mapped to the
subject of the
      <emphasis role="ital">subClassOf</emphasis>
property, then the role types (viz.
      <emphasis role="ital">superclass</emphasis>
and <emphasis role="ital">subclass</emphasis>)
will be lost.
      If we choose to ignore such a loss, the
compensation  will be a direct use of the RDF
      <emphasis role="ital">subClassOf</emphasis>
property with predefined semantics that captures
the
      intended meaning of the Topic Maps <emphasis role="ital">Superclass-Subclass</emphasis>
association. Similar
      arguments also apply to user defined
associations/properties such as based-on. However
the Topic Maps and
      RDF extensibility makes finding a user
defined property with equivalent semantics a
challenging task.</para><para>In contrast, a translation of source
content, which includes concepts that do not
exist in the target
      model, may result in a redundant set of
data, a set that remains unused by the agents
using the target
      representation. Indeed, we can translate a
Topic Maps binary association with role types and
role players
      into RDF by mapping it into a composition of
RDF properties that preserve the role concept.
Thus, it is
      possible to define a translation that
captures the semantics of a TM association.
However, the interpretation
      of the corresponding RDF composition
embodying the role concept is conveyed by an
external agreement for RDF.
      More importantly, semantic consistency does
not imply intentional consistency. An agent
reading the target
      may be unable to grasp the role concepts as
intended in the source. As a result, the original
intention
      assigned to association roles may be lost
despite their faithful translation. To make this
example more
      specific, consider a user-defined Topic Maps
association, <emphasis role="ital">employment</emphasis>,
      involving two roles, <emphasis role="ital">employer</emphasis> and <emphasis role="ital"> employee</emphasis>.
      The two roles can be translated into
matching RDF constructs participating in the
translated
      <emphasis role="ital">employment</emphasis>
association.  For example, for each role in the
      <emphasis role="ital"> employment</emphasis>
association we can include a statement
      whose property corresponds to the role type
(viz. <emphasis role="ital">employer</emphasis>
and
      <emphasis role="ital">employee</emphasis>);
its value is a property with predicate
      <emphasis role="ital">member</emphasis> that
references the role player, where referencing is
done
      through an additional (e.g. <emphasis role="ital">referencedBy </emphasis>) property.
      Obviously, this will increase the complexity
of the resulted translation while
      decreasing its readability.  More
importantly, despite their presence in the
resulting RDF encoding, the
      constructs corresponding to the employer and
employee roles may remain unused because they
correspond to
      concepts defined outside of RDF - the
existing RDF applications are designed with no
assumptions relating
      to query, search, display, etc., association roles. </para><para>It is even more challenging to
pragmatically integrate the TM contextual roles
(e.g. when a
      person playing a role of <emphasis role="ital">husband</emphasis> in one context is
playing a role of
      <emphasis role="ital"> father</emphasis> in
another context) in an RDF setting, ensuring
their practical
      utilization. When a topic map user applies a
scope to a particular statement, he does that
with certain
      intent. The scope concept with meaning
provided by the Topic Maps data model is
designated to capture this
      intention. Since there is no corresponding
term (and meaning) in the RDF vocabulary, this
intention can not
      be passed to the target. A possible approach
for overcoming such problems is to extend the RDF
vocabulary
      with terms for naming given RDF compositions
that correspond to particular Topic Maps concepts
      (e.g. <emphasis role="ital">rdf:scope</emphasis>).  However, we
believe that we should not target a translation
      that enforces or assumes that RDF users and
applications should “speak Topic Maps”.
</para><para>Translating in the opposite direction,
from RDF to Topic Maps, demonstrates slightly
different problems
     [<xref linkend="ref10"/>].
      Consider, for example, a general RDF
property, relating two resources identified by
their URIs. It can be
      mapped to either a TM binary association or
a TM occurrence. The correct mapping of the RDF
property to a
      Topic Maps format depends on the intended
meaning of the property (e.g. <emphasis role="ital">employment</emphasis>
      vs. <emphasis role="ital">seeAlso</emphasis>). On the  other
hand, properties such as
      <emphasis role="ital">rdf:type</emphasis> or
<emphasis role="ital">rdfs:label</emphasis> allow
us to map
      them unambiguously  to Topic Maps
expressions. The mapping in this particular case
is enabled by the existing
      <emphasis role="ital">rdf:type</emphasis>
and <emphasis role="ital">rdfs:label</emphasis>
semantics
      in the source language. However,
non-standard properties, such as <emphasis role="ital">rdf:is-described-by</emphasis>,
      <emphasis role="ital">rdf:plays</emphasis>
or, <emphasis role="ital">rdf:exists</emphasis>,
      do not carry predefined semantics and thus
can not be mapped based on any logical ground.
RDF does not make
      any assumption about their meaning except
that they relate two resources - one playing a
role of subject and
      the other a role of object. In this case a
semantic mapping to Topic Maps terms would
require a significant
      human involvement. If the property <emphasis role="ital">rdf:is-described-by</emphasis>
denotes a relationship
      with an information resource that is
pertinent to and enlightens a given subject, then
this property should be
      translated to a TM occurrence, otherwise it
should be translated to a TM binary association.
Note that a
      complete and accurate mapping will
      require additional decisions to be made
about the occurrence type and the role types of
the association in
      each of the corresponding decision steps. In
a situation like that, human involvement can not
be eliminated
      because a correct property translation will
require an understanding of the context of the
property, so its
      intended meaning and the resources it
involves can be captured. These distinctive
features of the two models
      and the differences in the compositional
granularity result in a mapping ambiguity and the
need of an
      additional vocabulary, such as RTM [<xref linkend="ref10"/>], [<xref linkend="ref23"/>],
for explicitly
      defining external meaning and intentions. </para></section><section><title>Design Requirements</title><para>Based on the above observations, we
focus on a translation that respects the meaning
while maximizing
      the usability of the translation result. To
achieve this we exploit the ontological
similarities between the
      models, which also allow natural integration
of the translated expressions into the target
formalism. As an
      additional requirement, we chose not to
support guided translation [<xref linkend="ref10"/>],
      [<xref linkend="ref29"/>], [<xref linkend="ref30"/>].  Thus, we assume that the
      source model is not annotated with specific
information for the purpose of guiding the
translation. This kind
      of annotation presumes familiarity with both
models. It is typically done manually and is a
costly exercise.
      A further assumption is that sharing
vocabularies across the two models is not
required. Our opinion is that
      the purpose of any translation is to make
translated concepts interpretable in terms of the
native vocabulary
      and to allow users not knowing a foreign
vocabulary to utilize it. In fact, the primary
role of the translation
      is to make users independent of a foreign
vocabulary. The above assumptions served as a
starting point for
      identifying the key requirements of the translation.  </para><section><title>Origins of the requirements</title><para>The basic idea driving the proposed
translation requirements is that RDF and Topic
Maps represent two models
      that overlap to a certain extent in their
modeling capabilities. This overlapping is at an
ontological level.
      It refers to similarities in the way things
are organized, e.g. similarities in the way
things are grouped into
      classes and the way things are related to
each other, to properties or to pertinent
information resources in
      both models. Any strategy for dealing with
overlapping concepts implies a decision about
what to do with
      non-overlapping concepts. However, the
intuition is that of the total amount of
available RDF and Topic Maps
      data <emphasis role="ital">the portion that
is represented with non-overlapping conceptual
structures is
      insignificant compared to the potentially
sharable information</emphasis>.  </para><para>The examples discussed in section 2.2
illustrate some translation problems inherent for
extensible
      frameworks such as RDF and Topic Maps.  In
such data models the vocabulary is not fixed, but
is open for
      defining new terms for particular
application domains. A further complication is
that when the data models
      differ in compositional granularity, the
recognition of coarser from finer structures in
general can not
      be done at a syntax level.  </para><para>On the other hand, there are a number
of initiatives, such as Dublin Core [<xref linkend="ref1"/>],
      [<xref linkend="ref7"/>], FOAF, etc., that
      provide fixed vocabularies with well defined
meanings.  Another trend in the Semantic Web is
the rise of data
      that commits to simple ontologies, like SKOS
[<xref linkend="ref16"/>], OBO and BIO. There are
also a number
      of predefined properties
      and classes in RDF, as well as associations
in Topic Maps. The predefined constructs provide
necessary
      information for accurate mapping.  Since a
full automatic translation between RDF and Topic
Maps is not
      feasible in general, one possibility is to
provide specialized translations among common
ontologies/schemas.
      Here we can draw an analogy with natural
languages, where there is a variety of
specialized language
      translations, such as in the technical,
medical, legal, and financial areas.  This
analogy suggests that
      a certain accuracy of the translation can be
achieved with a specialized translation. Such
domain-specific
      RDF2TM translations could cover a
significant portion of the RDF and Topic Maps
data on the Web. The
      remaining (smaller) portion will be the
subject of generic translation. </para><para>A set of overlapping concepts in RDF
and Topic Maps is given in Table 1. Another
example is the RDF
      dialect for the Dublin Core Metadata
Initiative (DCMI) and the corresponding dialect
under development from
      the Topic Maps community [<xref linkend="ref9"/>],[<xref linkend="ref17"/>],
[<xref linkend="ref25"/>].
      A useful set of overlapping concepts can be identified between the TM4L
      Topic Maps dialect [<xref linkend="ref8"/>],
[<xref linkend="ref9"/>] and SKOS. Obviously,
such overlaps
      with one-to-one correspondence enable a
      straightforward semantics-preserving
translation and allow round tripping. Since the
overlapping concepts
      allow translation with features matching the
requirements, they are made the subject of a
special (focused)
      translation.</para><table><caption><para>A set of overlapping concepts from the RDF and Topic Maps predefined vocabularies</para></caption><thead><tr><th>RDF</th><th>Topic Maps</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>resource</td><td>Topic</td></tr><tr><td>type</td><td>Class-Instance association</td></tr><tr><td>subClassOf</td><td>Superclass-Subclass association</td></tr><tr><td>seeAlso</td><td>Occurrence</td></tr><tr><td>label</td><td>Name</td></tr></tbody></table><para>We extend the set of overlapping
concepts to include TM binary associations and
RDF properties.
      To be consistent with the description of
overlapping concepts, we restrict the Topic Maps
binary associations
      to associations with all-scopes.  As for
RDF, we assume that the properties relating the
subjects to the
      relevant information resources
(corresponding to Topic Maps occurrences), are
identifiable from the general
      properties. These restrictions may seem too
limiting for potential applications. However, our
analysis
      indicates that in most applications, RDF is
used as metadata infrastructure. When the RDF
properties are
      used to relate resources analogous to Topic
Maps occurrences, they use Dublin Core
      (e.g. <emphasis role="ital">dc:Relation</emphasis> or <emphasis role="ital">dc:Source</emphasis>) or, for
      educational applications, the LOM
vocabulary, which makes them identifiable. The
part of non identifiable
      cases, then, is not so significant.</para></section><section><title>Requirements</title><para>The following is a list of requirements

adopted strategy aims to make

pre-existing agreement (between the two

concepts is to enable an RDF2TM translation that
integrates generic
      with focused translation in a single system.
The focused component of the translation is
intended to deal
      with the constructs identified as
“overlapping concepts”. This also includes
metadata vocabularies expressed
      in both RDF and Topic Maps in accordance
with recognized standards.  For such constructs
the translation is
      supposed to yield a semantics-preserving and
reversible translation (also referred sometimes
as “overlapping
      translation”). The remaining constructs
are subject to generic translation. We claim that
such an approach
      will result in a translation with an increased pragmatic value.</para><para>A significant portion of the
information in the Semantic Web comes in three
forms: metadata, taxonomies,
      and lightweight ontologies. (Some authors
argue that most of the Semantic Web is metadata
      [<xref linkend="ref35"/>].) This means
      that <emphasis role="ital">Superclass-Subclass,
Class-Instance</emphasis>, and Dublin Core
metadata
      form a vocabulary with a key role in the
Semantic Web. If we enable a lossless and
      faithful-to-the-original-intention
translation even only for the data expressed by
this “core vocabulary”,
      that will already be a contribution to the RDF-TM interoperability.</para><section><title>Focused (overlapping) translation</title><para>Since the separation between
overlapping and non-overlapping concepts is based
on syntactic distinctions,
      the differentiation of their translation
does not significantly increase the level of
complexity. The following
      strategy for translating RDF properties into
Topic Maps associations can be used as an
illustration of this
      approach. </para><para>The RDF <emphasis role="ital">type</emphasis> property is converted
to
      <emphasis role="ital">Class-Instance</emphasis>
association, where the subjects of the property
aremapped to the
      <emphasis role="ital">instance</emphasis>
members of the association and the objects of the
      <emphasis role="ital">type</emphasis>
property are mapped to the corresponding typing
topics. The RDF(S)
      <emphasis role="ital">subClassOf</emphasis> property is converted to
      <emphasis role="ital">Superclass-Subclass</emphasis>
association, where the subjects of the property
are mapped
      to the <emphasis role="ital">subclass</emphasis> association
members and the objects of the
      <emphasis role="ital">subClassOf</emphasis>
property are mapped to the <emphasis role="ital">superclass</emphasis>
      association members. RDFS <emphasis role="ital">label</emphasis>
 properties are converted to Topic <emphasis role="ital">names (baseName)</emphasis>. 
The predefined RDF(S) properties <emphasis role="ital">seeAlso</emphasis> are converted to
      Topic Maps occurrences, where the subject of
the property is converted to a topic and the
object of the property
      to the topic occurrence. More  specifically,
the object of the <emphasis role="ital">seeAlso</emphasis> property
      is converted to an external occurrence of
type <emphasis role="ital">Information
Resource</emphasis>. The remaining
      RDF properties (describing user defined
structures) are  subject to generic translation.
They are converted
      into a Topic Maps binary association with
two role types: <emphasis role="ital">subject</emphasis> and
      <emphasis role="ital">object</emphasis>,
mirroring the subject and the object of the
corresponding RDF property.
      The type of the association corresponds to
the predicate of the property.</para><para>Going in the reverse direction is
similar. All TM <emphasis role="ital">Class-Instance</emphasis> associations
      are converted to an RDF <emphasis role="ital">type</emphasis> property, where the
topic instances are mapped to the
      subjects and the typing topics of the
associations are mapped to the objects of the
      <emphasis role="ital">type</emphasis>
property. <emphasis role="ital">Superclass-Subclass</emphasis>
      associations are converted to a <emphasis role="ital">subClassOf</emphasis> property, where
the players of
      type <emphasis role="ital">superclass</emphasis> are mapped to
the objects and the players of type
      <emphasis role="ital">subclass</emphasis>
are mapped to the subjects of the
      <emphasis role="ital">subClassOf</emphasis> property. </para><para>The remaining binary associations are also
subject to focused  translation. The association
      <emphasis role="ital">assoc(player1:Role1,
player2:Role2)</emphasis> is translated to RDF(S)
by creating a property
      <emphasis role="ital">assoc</emphasis> with
domain <emphasis role="ital">Role1
(Role2)</emphasis> and range
      <emphasis role="ital">Role2
(Role1)</emphasis>.  Note that the choice of
which association role types to
      map to the domain and which one to the range
of the property is arbitrary. The lack of
predetermined mapping
      reflects the fact that, the TM role types
play a neutral role in the associations and any
decision of how to
      map them to the domain and range will have
equal effect on the translation. For example, one
possible
      translation of the association <emphasis role="ital">employment(Christo:employee,
WSSU:employer)</emphasis>
      into an RDF property may result in an RDF
property <emphasis role="ital">employment</emphasis> with domain
      <emphasis role="ital">employee</emphasis>
and range <emphasis role="ital">employer</emphasis>.
      This translation generates the property
<emphasis role="ital">employment</emphasis> that
applies to instances of
      the class <emphasis role="ital">employee</emphasis> and the values of
the <emphasis role="ital">employment</emphasis>
      property are instances of the class <emphasis role="ital">employer</emphasis>.
The other alternative
      will generate an RDF property <emphasis role="ital">employment</emphasis> with domain
      <emphasis role="ital">employer</emphasis>
and range <emphasis role="ital">employee</emphasis>, which
      means that the property <emphasis role="ital">employment</emphasis> now applies to
instances of the
      class <emphasis role="ital">employment</emphasis> and the values
of the property are instances of the class
      <emphasis role="ital">employee</emphasis>.
Since the Topic Maps associations are
directionally neutral,
      there is no danger of reversing the
directionality  of the origin. Instead, we are
fixing it. As Topic Maps
      do not assume any directionality, the names
of the associations are typically articulated by
a direction-neutral
      terms (e.g. <emphasis role="ital">employment</emphasis>).  Thus, the
selection of the directionality does not
      affect the readability of the translation result.</para><para>Topic Maps external occurrences are
converted to a <emphasis role="ital">seeAlso</emphasis> property
      with an object of the occurrence URI.
Internal occurrences are also converted to a
      <emphasis role="ital">seeAlso</emphasis>
property with an object of the internal resource
(string). Finally topic
      <emphasis role="ital">names</emphasis> are
converted to an RDFS <emphasis role="ital">label</emphasis> property.</para></section><section><title>Translating between RDF and Topic Maps metadata formats</title><para>As stated earlier, the goal of this
work is to foster the interchange of resources
between RDF and Topic Maps.
      However, resource semantics is a broad term,
which includes ontologies, metadata and
instance-data. From the
      perspective of a librarian, cataloger or
publisher, the Semantic Web is a metadata
initiative. Therefore,
      successful interoperation requires an
efficient strategy of how the standard categories
of metadata relate to
      each other across RDF and Topic Maps
formats.  The current web includes ontologies and
metadata developed by
      different communities, such as Dublin Core
metadata, FOAF etc. FOAF data currently makes the
bulk of the
      Semantic Web information. Another trend is
the rise of data that commits to simple
ontologies like SKOS.
      The proposed approach combining translation
of overlapping concepts with generic translation
also incorporates
      methods specializing in specific metadata
formats and dialect vocabularies. The inclusion
of metadata into
      “overlapping concepts” is a reflection
of the existence of both RDF and Topic Maps
standards for encoding the
      included metadata. The standardization is an
important component that integrates them in both
languages and
      makes them overlapping concepts. For example
DCMI currently has a Recommendation for
expressing Dublin Core
      in RDF/XML [<xref linkend="ref1"/>],
[<xref linkend="ref20"/>] and a new work item was
recently approved
      by ISO for a Type 3 Technical Report on Expressing
      Dublin Core Metadata Using Topic Maps [<xref linkend="ref25"/>], [<xref linkend="ref26"/>].
      Assuming a two-format representation, the translation turns
      into a simple mapping between two standard
encodings of the same metadata concepts.</para><para>Table 2 shows the proposed translation
between RDF and Topic Maps representation of
Dublin Core Metadata.
      Based on the recommended encoding of the
Simple Dublin Core Metadata Element Set [<xref linkend="ref7"/>]
      and following Pepper [<xref linkend="ref25"/>], elements <emphasis role="ital"> contributor, coverage,
      creator, type, format, language,
      publisher, relation, source</emphasis> and
<emphasis role="ital">subject</emphasis> are
translated into an
      association of  the corresponding type (see
Table 2). The resource to which metadata is being
assigned
      is represented as an association role of
type <emphasis role="ital">resource</emphasis>,
while
      the other  role of the association is of
type <emphasis role="ital">value</emphasis>. The
elements
      <emphasis role="ital">date, description,

      are represented as occurrences, while the
element <emphasis role="ital">title</emphasis> is
represented
      as a topic name.</para><para>The reverse direction is obvious. Topic

which entails the inverse relation of subject and object.  </para></section><section><title>Generic Translation</title><para>Semantics preserving translation is
just one of the criteria guiding our translation
strategy.
      As we mentioned earlier, the translation is
intended to facilitate interoperability. The
interoperability
      is measured by the ability of the two models
to share common concepts. Concepts that have no
match in the
      other model are among the ones that make the
translation task difficult. For such concepts it
is possible
      to provide translation generating
semantically equivalent results such that even a
user familiar with RDF
      and Topic Maps will hardly recognize and
understand. Therefore, for non overlapping concepts
we combine
      our criteria with <emphasis role="ital">pragmatic
interoperability</emphasis>. Pragmatic
interoperability
      is used to measure the utilization of the
translation result for achieving the agent’s
goals.  It is in
      line with the intentional consistency as a
measure of the occurrences when the intended
meaning of the
      translation is in agreement with its actual
interpretation from agents operating on the
source. The proposed
      generic translation is intended to generate
syntactically correct encoding in terms of the
target model
      with minimal intentional inconsistency with
respect to the original. All Topic Maps and RDF
concepts that
      do not have corresponding counterparts in
the other model (i.e. with no matching target
concepts) are
      subject to generic translation.  Strictly
speaking, the term “generic translation”
refers to a combination
      of translations and transformations. The
semantics of particular source concept may change
its meaning
      when translated into the target model in
order to make use of existing concepts with
similar meaning
      instead of introducing new ones.
Syntactically correct RDF (Topic Maps) output
generated by the proposed
      approach does not always imply a compete
translation. It is possible that part of the
input changes both
      the representation and semantics during the translation. </para><para>The Topic Maps N-ary associations are

item (e.g. name or occurrence)

      abuse of the <emphasis role="ital">Whole-Part</emphasis> association. To
avoid defining new non-standard
      associations we (inaccurately) treat list
members as part of a particular container of type
      <emphasis role="ital">List</emphasis>. Thus
RDF list members are represented as parts of a
topic
      of type <emphasis role="ital">List</emphasis> .</para></section></section><section><title>Implementation and Examples</title><para>The tool providing the translation
between RDF and Topic Maps has been designed as a
plug-in to the Topic Maps
      editing environment, TM4L
(http://compsci.wssu.edu/iis/nsdl/
download.html). TM4L [<xref linkend="ref9"/>]
      development was driven
      by two competing considerations: to provide
a general purpose Topic Map editor and to create
an e-learning
      environment providing authoring and browsing
support for creating ontology-based learning
content and for
      structuring digital repositories. To be
consistent with the intended support and
functionality, TM4L has
      extended the basic Topic Map vocabulary with
predefined associations that are of specific
importance to
      organizing digital collections. The
vocabulary supported by TM4L can be viewed as a
light Topic Map dialect.
      The translation tool being a plug-in to TM4L
interprets the TM4L (extended) vocabulary as a
basic Topic Maps
      vocabulary.  That explains why the
associations of type <emphasis role="ital">Whole-Part</emphasis> and
      <emphasis role="ital">Related</emphasis> are
dealt with focused translation. The first version
of the plug-in was
      released for public use and testing in
October 2007. The next version is planed for
August 2008. </para><para>The following are examples intended to
demonstrate the work of the translation plug-in.
The examples
      are presented based on RDF/XML format (for
RDF) and XTM (for Topic Maps). The reason to use
the verbose
      XTM format is because (i) the Topic Map
input/output from TM4L is in XTM format; (ii)
there is no official
      standard for a compact Topic Maps syntax. </para><para>The first one demonstrates translations
of RDF to Topic Maps. The RDF statement asserting
that the
      resource with <emphasis role="ital">rdf:label</emphasis> property value
      <emphasis role="ital">Spinach
Lasagna</emphasis> is an instance of the resource
with
      <emphasis role="ital">rdf:label</emphasis>
property value <emphasis role="ital">Lasagna</emphasis> is
      translated into an equivalent Topic Maps set
of assertions: namely, the topic with basename
      <emphasis role="ital">Spinach Lasagna</emphasis> is an instance
      of the topic with basename <emphasis role="ital">Lasagna</emphasis>.

share and reuse as much information as possible.
       A significant amount of work is being done
to match different vocabularies.  In this area
there have
       been considerable studies of approaches for
ontology mapping where the concept of sharing and
reusability
       has been interlinked to merging, alignment,
articulation and fusion of ontologies [<xref linkend="ref13"/>],
       [<xref linkend="ref14"/>, [<xref linkend="ref31"/>].
       In parallel, a number of different
languages for ontology modeling have been
proposed [<xref linkend="ref5"/>],
       [<xref linkend="ref12"/>], [<xref linkend="ref34"/>], [<xref linkend="ref37"/>],
[<xref linkend="ref38"/>],
       [<xref linkend="ref39"/>].
       The problem of interoperation of
heterogeneous data, based on different data
models and modeling languages
       like RDF, Topic Maps, UML, etc. implies
model-based methods aiming at model-level
interoperability.
       As a result, a number of informal
model-to-model mappings have been defined,
including several proposals
       for mapping between Topic Maps and RDF
[<xref linkend="ref2"/>], [<xref linkend="ref5"/>], [<xref linkend="ref6"/>],
       [<xref linkend="ref7"/>], [<xref linkend="ref8"/>], [<xref linkend="ref9"/>].
Despite the emerging
       interest in the problem
       and the availability of some mapping tools,
the reports on integration and reuse of data
across the two
       models are scarce.</para><para>Moore [<xref linkend="ref18"/>] was
perhaps the first to propose a general strategy
towards
       integration between Topic Maps
      and RDF. Lacher and Decker [<xref linkend="ref15"/>] presented a model for mapping
between the two
      standards by exploiting the
      “Topicmaps.net’s Processing Model for
XTM 1.0” [<xref linkend="ref19"/>].
Technically, the conversion
      from Topic Maps to RDF is
      achieved by mapping the Topic Map graph
model to an RDF graph. Another work in the area
of TM2RDF mapping
      has been presented by Ogievetski. His
starting point is also [<xref linkend="ref19"/>]
but he uses
      XSLT-based technology to
      translate any topic map document expressed
in XTM into RDF abbreviated syntax. The relation
between Topic Maps
      and RDF are discussed in detail by Garshol
[<xref linkend="ref10"/>], [<xref linkend="ref11"/>]. The
      proposal in [<xref linkend="ref5"/>] is the most mature work in the field,
      which describes how to convert information
back and forth between the two technologies, how
to convert schema
      information, and how to do queries across
both information representations.  Some
strategies and algorithms
      to achieve these goals are also presented
along with a discussion of the problems of
conversion between
      Topic Maps and RDF. A practical result of
this work is the extension of the Ontopia’s
Topic Map browser
      Omnigator (http://www.ontopia.net) with
functionality allowing export/import between
Topic Maps and RDF data.</para><para>An interesting work on integration
between the Topic Maps and RDF technologies has
been done as part
      of the META project, resulting in a set of
tools for converting, editing and navigating
metadata expressed
      in either language [<xref linkend="ref3"/>].
In this work the authors present their approach
to the
      bidirectional conversion of RDF
      and Topic Maps and show how the use of
schemas and standard predicates in RDF can lead
to a flexible integration
      of the two languages. This integration is in
the heart of the effort aimed at incorporating
separate modules into
      a single editing and navigation tool that
can be used for metadata collections expressed in
both languages.</para><para>An analysis of the relationship between
Topic Maps and RDF and a complete review and
comparison of the
      RDF/Topic Maps interoperability proposals
can be found in [<xref linkend="ref28"/>].
Despite the efforts
      and the proposed Guidelines
      for RDF/Topic Maps Interoperability [<xref linkend="ref29"/>], however, there is no fully
worked out and
      widely agreed upon solution
      to achieving data interoperability between RDF and Topic Maps yet.</para><para>Among the relevant works there are also
the efforts for translating between Topic Maps
and ontology
      models such as OWL and UML [<xref linkend="ref4"/>], [<xref linkend="ref6"/>].</para><para>While our work might seem close to the
previous proposals on the surface, there are
principal differences
      stemming from the different perception of
the commonalities in both models. For example,
the key correspondences
      between RDF and Topic Maps according to
Garshol and Pepper [<xref linkend="ref10"/>],
[<xref linkend="ref29"/>]
      are “subject (TM) — resource (RDF)” and
      “topic (TM) — node (RDF)”, which is
reflected in their mapping strategy. In contrast,
our approach builds on
      ontological correspondence.  Commonalities
are better explicated in correspondences between
how the things are
      related than in correspondences between the
things alone. Thus, the “overlapping
approach” reflects our
      understanding of the role of a shared
ontological ground for meaning preserving
translation. This sets the
      starting point in our translation strategy
on overlapping concepts with reliance on existing
and established
      vocabularies (e.g. RDF/RDFS, Dublin Core,
and SKOS). The key factors of this strategy
include minimizing the
      need of (i) a centralized agreement on new
vocabulary terms emerging from the translation
and (ii) an agreement
      of how to guide the translation process. </para><para>In contrast to previous work,
considering the completeness of translation as a
key requirement, our
      starting point here was the question: Which
Topic Maps constructs can be represented
naturally in RDF (i.e.
      as RDF graphs) without RDF vocabulary
extension? We also asked the reverse question:
Which are the RDF
      constructs naturally expressible in Topic
Maps? Since, generally, full automatic
translation between RDF and
      Topic Maps is not possible, one possibility
is to focus on semantic-preserving translation of
the
      ontologies/schemas with common conceptual
space. Translation satisfying such requirements
can be achieved by
      identifying the overlapping conceptual
domains of both models. Another difference is
that our approach does
      not assume any annotation for guiding the
translation. As a result, pre-translating human
involvement is
      eliminated.</para><para>Among the most challenging tasks in the
area of Topic Maps/RDF interoperability is the
problem of
      translating the Topic Maps concept of scope.
Except for Garshol [<xref linkend="ref10"/>] no
other
      works handle scope in satisfactory
      manner. The list of challenging problems
also includes mapping variant names and RDF types
such as containers
      and collections. None of the existing tools
which provide translation between RDF and Topic
Maps are able to
      handle containers and collections. The only
approach for dealing with variant names is that
of Ciancarini et
      al [<xref linkend="ref3"/>], [<xref linkend="ref30"/>].  They suggest translating
variant names
      as compound concepts, which is quite unintuitive. Our
      strategy with non-overlapping concepts is
similar to the way terms are traditionally
translated from one
      language to another with a more limited
vocabulary, namely, with a maximal reuse of the
source vocabulary that
      is able to convey the intended meaning of the original. </para></section><section><title>Conclusion</title><para>Taking the information from one
representation scheme (such as Topic Maps) and
extracting some
      or all of it for use in another scheme (such
as RDF) is a difficult task [<xref linkend="ref2"/>].
      In fact, few working tools
      exist to perform such transformations. One
reason such conversions are difficult is that
representation
      schemes differ in the basic structural
constructs, granularity and schema constraints
they provide for
      organizing information. As a consequence, straightforward, one-to-one
mappings between schemes rarely exist.</para><para>In this context, the presented work is
a contribution to the efforts aimed at improving
the
      interoperability between Topic Maps and RDF.
It has been carried on as a part of the TM4L
project. The driving
      insight was to allow TM4L users to use RDF
data and also enable RDF applications to use
Topic Maps data produced
      with TM4L. During the implementation stage,
the initial objective was broadened to create a
general tool for
      RDF - Topic Maps translation. In the
proposed approach, the balance between
translation and transformation is
      in agreement with the target model. The type
of translation applied to a particular construct
depends on the
      level of overlapping between the
corresponding concepts in the two models.  The
idea is to provide a translation,
      from which the reader in the target is able
to grasp the intended meaning of the original
author. This implies
      a translation with acceptable loss of
information when complete translation is
impractical.</para><para>The proposed Topic Maps/RDF translation
approach is implemented as a plug-in for TM4L.
Although the
      illustrative examples mostly cover Topic
Maps to RDF mapping, the actual implementation
enables round tripping
      translation for a significant class of
RDF/Topic Maps concepts. The idea is to enable
Topic Maps users not
      only to merge existing Topic Maps data with
RDF data but also to exploit some inference
capability and then
      translate the results back into Topic Maps.</para></section><bibliography><title>Bibliography</title><bibliomixed xml:id="ref1" xreflabel="Beck02">Beckett D., Miller E.,
