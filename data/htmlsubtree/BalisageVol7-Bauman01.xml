            <div class="para e7">This paper explores some of the ramifications of the
               inherent tension between the desire to analyze our own data and
               to share it with others — between our desire to be expressive
               and our desire to be conformant — particularly with respect to
               
               <div class="emphasis e8">interchangeability</div> vs.
               
               <div class="emphasis e9">interoperability</div>, positing that focusing on
               interoperability is to focus on sharing at the expense of
               analysis.

               <div class="para e15">Syd Bauman began working at the Women Writers Project
                  in 1990. Although his title would have you believe that he
                  is a computer programmer, Syd is fond of pointing out that
                  he doesn’t write that much actual code. When he does, it is
                  usually in  XSLT, Bash, Perl, or Emacs Lisp, and is always
                  copylefted.

               <div class="para e16">Syd became a hard-core computer user in 1982, and a
                  devotee of descriptive markup two years later. He began
                  using SGML and the TEI when he came to the Women Writers
                  Project.

               <div class="para e17">From 2001 to 2007 Syd served as North American editor
                  of the TEI. During his tenure Syd became interested in the
                  differences among negotiated interchange, blind interchange,
                  and interoperability, and how these processes inflect our
                  thoughts on document design.

            envisioned. That is, to develop a markup system that separates out
            the parts of the document you find interesting and describes that
            which is interesting about them in sufficient detail.

            you no good whatsoever for me to send you a manuscript
            transcription in a proprietary binary format which your computer
            cannot read, and not much good to send it in an open text format
            you do not understand. In order for you to make use of the
            transcription, we need to have a shared understanding of both
            the operating details and semantics of the markup language
            used.

         <div class="para e70">However, because the details of humanities texts that
            scholars wish to engage with and the assertions scholars wish to
            make about these texts are (almost definitionally, I daresay) so
            widely varied, no single markup language could possibly represent
            them all. That is, no markup language can meet the second goal for
            all scholars simultaneously. A given markup language can represent
            some of the analytic needs of all of the scholars, and all of the
            analytic needs of some of the scholars, but it can not represent
            all the analytic needs of all of the scholars. This holds whether
            the markup language is a widely used standard language like TEI,
            or a home-grown language specific to the purpose.

            particular individual, a shared language would be required — in
            order for a language to be shared, both the sender and the
            receiver, regardless of discipline, whether they know each other
            or not, or whether they can even talk to each other or not, must
            agree on it, even if only implicitly. But in fact the third goal
            is about sharing data in a collaborative fashion with almost
            arbitrary interested parties. In this case, an agreed upon and
            widely known markup language is required.

         <div class="para e106">But moreover, these are not the definitions the designers of
            TEI (and perhaps other data interchange systems) had in mind when
            they originally discussed interchange, whether negotiated or
            blind. E.g., back when TEI P1 was released (1990-07), many of the
            concerns about interchange were concerns about just getting the
            data from one machine to another with the same characters. Only
            then could you worry about the syntax of the encoding system and
            the semantics of the particular encoding language.

            It has taken the advent of more standardized character encoding
            (i.e., ISO 10646 and Unicode), more widely and uniformly supported
            transport protocols (e.g., FTP and HTTP), standard encoding
            schemes to work-around 7-bit mail gateways (e.g., base64
            encoding), and standard ways to indicate content type (e.g. MIME),
            for us to be able to transport files from one place to another
            with such ease that we barely think about it. These great strides
            in computer technology allow us to take faithful transmission of a
            series of characters for granted; thus I will not consider it
            further in this paper.

                        interoperability. I chose that term in order to evoke both the
                        idea that something (in this case a text document) works, or
                        functions, across some boundary; and the fact that in mathematics
                        as well as computer science a function is not (in general)
                        commutative:

            means that whether or not a document can be considered

            <div class="emphasis e152">every</div> XML file is interoperational. That is,

         <div class="para e197">Many XML user communities will at least bristle at my
            assertion that interoperability is difficult, and some people will
            even object, using their own projects as counter-examples. For
            example, it may be quite easy to take documents in 
            <div class="xref e198" linkend="SVG"></div> or 
            <div class="xref e199" linkend="Triple-S"></div> and use them in an
            application other than the one for which they were originally
            written. But I hold that interoperationality is not just about use
            of XML data in current predicted applications (
            <div class="quote e200">I will want
               to use this file in an SVG viewer
            </div>), but rather is also
            concerned with the use of data with both unintended applications
            (e.g., linguistic analysis of survey questions) and future
            applications (e.g., submitting a set of vector graphics images to
            software that makes a mosaic of them).
         </div>
         <div class="para e201">Notice that I am being (deliberately) self-contradictory,
            here. I am suggesting that interoperability is always contextual,
            that we need to know what application we are trying to operate
            with in order to measure our success at interoperationality; and
            simultaneously that in order to be considered interoperational, a
            document should work with applications that are not only
            unforeseen, but haven’t even been written yet. If the application
            has not been written yet, it is obviously impossible to know
            whether or not our data will work with it. It is this very
            contradiction that drives me to say that interoperationality is
            hard. We cannot know the various contexts in which we would like
            our files achieve interoperationality.

            interoperationality difficult for a language like SVG, which has
            both very tight operational (as opposed to declarative) semantics
            and a sharp focus on particular kinds of processing. But TEI is a
            declarative language that is intended to record, for various
            disparate purposes, an enormously wide array of texts (to wit,
            those of interest to humanities scholars). Thus its semantics are
            necessarily somewhat looser, its ambitions are sky-high, and its
            field of view is very wide.
         </div>
         <div class="para e211">For example, consider an application (present or future)
            that for some purpose wishes to process the authorial words in
            the main content of a TEI-encoded document; that is, we need to
            parse out the words, but ignore things like metadata, running
            heads, editorial notes, chapter titles, etc. Many TEI projects
            have had reason to 
            <div class="quote e212">extract the words</div> in this way,
            and have found it not particularly difficult to do. But doing so
            for a 
            <div class="emphasis e213" role="bold">generic</div> TEI file turns out
            to be impossible, and many people find this surprising. (Remember
            that TEI, like many languages, is really a framework for building
            a particular markup language with many, but not all, features in
            common with other TEI languages.)
         </div>
         <div class="para e214">Before demonstrating that this is impossible, I will first
            elaborate on one of the reasons it is hard: end-of-line
            hyphenation. In order to parse words out from the input document,
            we need to know whether a hyphen at the end-of-line is hard or
            soft. In many cases this is obvious to a human
            (
            <div class="quote e215">pro-tection</div> vs. 
            <div class="quote e216">pro-choice</div>), but in
            some it is not at all clear (e.g., 
            <div class="quote e217">Sea-mark</div>
            <div class="xref e218" linkend="CeHx"></div>), and it is generally harder for computers than
            for humans. The TEI currently (P5 v. 1.9.1) provides at least five
            different methods for encoding soft hyphens at end-of-line, three
            of which might use different characters for the representation of
            the hyphen itself (which is displayed as a hyphen (U+002D) in the
            listing below), and some previous releases of TEI allowed even
            more. This may strike some as silly or even excessive, but in most
            cases these choices make sense. For example, the TEI cannot
            prescribe to scholars who are not remotely interested in original
            lineation or soft hyphens that they record these features.

            files difficult. Some, however, actually make it impossible. For
            example, in TEI annotations or notes are recorded in a
            
            <div class="code e228">&lt;note&gt;</div> element, whether the note is an aside, an

         <div class="para e233">Some might think that, on the surface, interchange is harder
            than interoperation. After all, it requires human
            intervention. And certainly dropping a file into a system and
            
            <div class="quote e234">presto</div> it works is far easier than doing work to
            get your system to process the file as desired. But we’re talking
            here about the effort needed to make a file that is interoperable
            vs. interchangeable. As I’ve just described, for many purposes it
            will be impossible to process a random TEI file with a given
            system without intervention. Thus however difficult it is to make
            interchangeable files, it is easier than making interoperable
            ones.
         </div>
         <div class="para e235">The bad news is that it can take quite a bit of work to make
            a file easily interchangeable with generic future processes. The
            good news is that the effort put into making it interchangeable
            does double-duty, and simultaneously increases the data’s
            longevity by making curation of the file easier. (After all,
            porting a file forward to a different platform of some sort is a
            process, and we can think of the file as being interchangeable
            with that process.)
         </div>
         <div class="para e236">The reason it takes work to make a file interchangeable is
            because (in general) it requires that the semantics, not just the
            syntax, of the encoding be explained to the humans involved with
            consuming the file. In order to know which 
            <div class="code e237">&lt;note&gt;</div>
            elements should be ignored, our prospective word-counter needs to
            know what the various possible values of the 
            <div class="code e238">@type</div>
            attribute mean. Yes, one can imagine a system in which the values
            are inherently obvious to one who speaks the natural language
            which the values (which are arbitrary NCNames) are designed to
            mimic (
            <div class="code e239">"authorial"</div>, 
            <div class="code e240">"transcriptional"</div>,
            etc.), but this is not the general case, and moreover there is no
            guarantee that the future consumer of the file speaks that natural
            language or uses those terms the same way.
         </div>
         <div class="para e241">Thus contemporaneously generated detailed prose
            documentation of the indicative logical markup constructs used to
            mark up a text can significantly facilitate the use of the text in
            future systems and processes, both those we can predict and those
            we cannot, both by those that generated the text and by unforeseen
            recipients of it. Put more succinctly, providing descriptions of
            the descriptive markup can make future interchange of a document
            possible where it might have been impossible, or easy where it
            might have been hard.

            be ascribed to the liberty of expressiveness in the encoding of
            humanistic texts. The free expression of scholarly ideas embodied in

            helps to improve them.

            areas of an encoding system that are designed to permit the
            liberty of expressiveness (e.g., the 
            <div class="code e262">@type</div> attribute
            of 
            <div class="code e263">&lt;tei:note&gt;</div>) are going to permit documents that
            are less like (i.e., less equal to) the other documents intended

         <div class="para e264">Said another way, to make her document (more) interoperational,
            an encoder either needs to know the application semantics of
            interest ahead of time, or needs to stick rigidly to prescriptions
            (sometimes, but not always, expressed as schemas) that she
            believes the target application (which may not be known) will be
            able to understand. But rigidly sticking to the encoding that (she
            thinks that) the target application needs, or 
            <div class="quote e265">encoding to
               the stylesheet

            handled by the target application. Common sense says this could
            result in, and my experience says this often does result in,
            encoder’s deliberately using encodings that are substandard, less
            faithful to the document, or outright incorrect per the encoding

            express the features of interest to them in individual ways. While
            this is not always a bad thing, differing expressions of content

         <div class="para e302">In summary, since interoperationality (equality) is often
            bought at the expense of expressivity (liberty), interoperability
            is the wrong goal for scholarly humanities text
            encoding. Practitioners of this activity should aim for blind
            interchange. This still requires a lot of adherence to standards
            (e.g., TEI), but eschews mindless adherence that curtails
            expression of our ideas about our texts.
