         <div class="title e21">Writers just wanna write</div>
         <div class="para e22">The initial impetus for this research grew out of a facile
            observation many years ago that an author had to learn SGML in
            order to use an SGML editor.
         </div>
         <div class="para e23">This is a necessary requirement in many fields where the
            content is complex: for example encoding literary or historical
            documents in TEI, or writing computer systems documentation in
            DocBook. The author needs to understand what markup is available
            so that it can be used to describe the finely-detailed features
            accurately, but the naming and function of the markup is not
            always entirely obvious (
            <div class="xref e24" linkend="Reid1980"></div>,
            
            <div class="xref e25" linkend="Joloboff1989"></div>).
         </div>
         <div class="para e26">By contrast, to submit a paper to a conference, an article
            to a journal, or a book to a publisher, the conventional author
            uses a wordprocessor, or another standard like LaTeX. It is
            the author's responsibility to adhere to the sometimes arcane or
            inconsistent formatting instructions provided by the publisher,
            even when assisted by the publisher's style template.
         </div>
         <div class="para e27">Publishers have traditionally mistrusted authors who do
            their own formatting, even when using the publishers'
            specifications to provide final-format copy. Authors, for their
            part, are always encountering new reasons why
            
            <div class="emphasis e28">their</div> article, book, or paper has to be
            formatted differently. Where a stylesheet is provided, abusing
            or ignoring the styles is common, because it is sometimes the
            only way to get the formatting the author believes necessary,
            because they feel they should be in charge of the formatting
            (
            <div class="xref e29" linkend="Piez2007"></div>, 
            <div class="xref e30" linkend="Ebel2005"></div>). In
            many cases the solution is for the production team to remove all
            the author's formatting and send the document to a typesetter to
            have the house style applied.
         </div>
         <div class="para e31">In wordprocessors, structure is largely non-existent in the
            markup, and only interpretable by human eyes through the
            formatting. Synchronous typographic (ST) editing (usually, if
            inaccurately, called WYSIWYG) has been the standard interface
            for some decades, but it hides the markup boundaries so
            effectively that accurate editing is sometimes
            impossible.

               <div id="d1e57" style="display: none;">
                  <div class="footnote">
                     <div class="para e33">One editor, compiling chapters from different authors,
                        	  unwittingly pasted all but the first chapter into the final
                        	  footnote of the first chapter, because the cursor appeared
                        	  to be at the end of the chapter, and OpenOffice permitted
                        	  the footnote to hold eleven chapters' worth of text!
                     </div>
                  </div>
               </div>
            </div> In XML and LaTeX editors, the adoption of ST
            editing was slower although it is now widespread.
         </div>
         <div class="para e34">Unless there has been some extensive (and expensive)
            customization, conventional use of a structured-document editor
            usually means learning the language, the specific markup
            required for the domain, and the logic or business rules that
            accompany it. Much of this is far beyond the comfort zone of
            those writers who have no exposure to markup but nevertheless
            still have cause to write a document under the constraint of
            producing a specific (structured) file format.
         </div>
         <div class="para e35">The objective of this research was to see how much of the
            cognitive, perceptual, and technical burden of creating a
            formally-structured document might be relieved by changing some
            of the ways in which the interface works.
         </div>
         <div class="para e36">In earlier work we found that most writers simply want to
            write in what they perceive to be the 
            <div class="quote e37">easiest</div> way
            (ST), adding what formatting they deem appropriate, without ever
            seeing a pointy bracket or a backslash, and without having to
            come to terms with the language of trees and graph theory,
            predicate logic, or document engineering (
            <div class="xref e38" linkend="Flynn2009"></div>). While this desire was generally
            acknowledged by experts, it was felt possibly to be one of the
            reasons for the failure of XML and LaTeX to be adopted as
            general authoring formats outside their related technical
            fields.

            hard to use, misleading to identify, difficult to find, or
            non-functional in the structured editing systems they had used.
            A few of these (eg equation formatting) were outside the scope
            of the research; some were not specifically markup issues

               	by the target population.
            </div>
            <div class="para e358">In addition, a number of unexplored techniques were
               	identified which could contribute to lower user frustration,
               	among them Target Markup Adoption and Smart Insertion.
            </div>
            <div class="para e359">The benefits likely to accrue from these changes are
               	greater user satisfaction and less training, leading to
               	increased productivity and greater accuracy in document
               	construction.
            </div>
            <div class="para e360">We did not directly test whether these benefits would lead
               	to lower costs within an organisation, as there are many other
               	factors which affect this, including the organisational change
               	which may be required to move to a new system. However, as
               	several of them have recently been implemented in interfaces,
               	including Word and Xopus, there appears to be a willingness
               	among manufacturers as well as users to use them.
