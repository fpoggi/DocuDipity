         <div class="abstract e6">
            <div class="para e7">XQuery provides an excellent means for teaching programming to digital humanists
               because it works seamlessly with their existing XML data, has an elegant and simple
               core with a well-structured standard library, and can be used in conjunction with
               XML databases to develop end-to-end web applications. However, current teaching
               materials for XQuery do not address the needs of digital humanists, presupposing
               implicit knowledge of programming concepts that they frequently lack. Based on
               experience teaching XQuery to digital humanists (including alt-ac professionals,
               archivists, faculty members, graduate students, and librarians) in three distinct
               settings: a weekly training session for librarians, a graduate seminar on digital
               humanities, and a two week NEH-supported Institute for Advanced Topics in Digital
               Humanities, I suggest how the XML community might develop resources to widen the
               appeal and accessibility of XQuery.

         <div class="title e25">Defining the Digital Humanities</div>
         <div class="para e26">So this paper is about teaching XQuery to digital humanists, which raises the
            question, who are the digital humanists I have in mind? The exercise of defining the
            digital humanities is among the most popular and, at this point, hackneyed exercises
            in
            the digital humanities. I'm sure that I could solicit multiple definitions from the
            attendees of Balisage. Some of you here helped to bring about the field of the "digital
            humanities" from the now largely superseded concept of "humanities computing" (see
            
            <div class="citation e27" linkend="Piez2008">Piez 2008</div>). As far as it goes, I like the
            definition in the recently-published "Proposal for a Digital Humanities Center at
            Princeton University."

                  <div class="blockquote">
                     <div class="para e29">'Digital Humanities' refers to the use and application of computational tools
                        and methods to humanist domains of study, but also the opposite, the application
                        of humanistic questions to computer science: from history to papyrology, from
                        comparative literature to historical geography, and to the artistic or
                        humanities-influenced design of computational artifacts. 
                        <div class="citation e30" linkend="Martin2013">Martin 2013</div>

                  </div>
               </div>
            </div>The definition is instructively broad. On the one hand, it encompasses the
            whole range of tools that humanists use in the course of their research and teaching.
            On
            the other, it indicates that digital humanities involves taking a critical perspective
            on these tools. In other words, digital humanities is not just about using PowerPoint
            to
            display information to a class but also thinking about how PowerPoint as a medium
            shapes
            and influences the transmission of that information. Inevitably, digital humanities
            tends to divide into those who concentrate on the development of computational
            approaches to humanistic problems and those who prefer to interpolate digital media
            critically.

                     <div class="para e32">I owe this observation to Dr. Jay Clayton, William R. Kenan, Jr. Professor of
                        English at Vanderbilt University, who presented a guest lecture on divisions
                        within the digital humanities on Tuesday, June 10 in the context of our XQuery
                        Summer Institute.

                  </div>
               </div>
            </div> The methodologists themselves work across a wide variety of fields and with
            a large number of tools, including digital text editing, geographical information
            systems (GIS), natural language processing, network analysis, the semantic web and
            statistical analysis, to name only a few. Obviously, no single researcher can be
            competent in all these areas. Accordingly, the digital humanities has been described
            as
            a "big tent," though according to Patrik Svensson it might better be described as
            "a
            meeting place, innovation hub, and trading zone." 
            <div class="citation e33" linkend="Svensson2012">Svensson 2012, p. 46</div> In short, the digital humanities is less a
            discipline than a meeting place of practitioners of various disciplines with different
            levels of skill, different modes of production, and differing degrees of critical
            insight on their work.
         </div>
         <div class="para e34">The practical point is that one cannot assume anything when teaching "digital
            humanists." There are no prerequisites to calling oneself a "digital humanist" beyond,
            I
            suppose, a general interest in computation and the humanities. As a practical matter,
            digital humanists hail from many different parts of the academy as well as from outside
            its cloisters. In a broad sense, administrators, faculty members, graduate students,
            librarians, alt-ac scholars, and information technologists may all credibly claim
            to be
            digital humanists. Their perspectives on digital humanities will differ broadly
            according to discipline and social-economic location. Professors generally enter the
            digital humanities with specific research agendas. Librarians, by contrast, do not
            generally have their own research programs; more typically, they're seeking new ways
            to
            provide and improve access to the collections under their care. Graduate students
            may be
            exploring the options or working as assistants on faculty projects while contemplating
            alt-act alternatives to standard tenure-track careers. At best, the digital humanities
            provides the "meeting place" for these fellow-travellers. As Julia Flanders remarks,
            <div class="popupBox e35">
               <div class="popupLabel" onmouseover="$('#d1e62').show('1000');" onmouseout="$('#d1e62').hide('1000');">[ blockquote ]</div>

                  <div class="blockquote">
                     <div class="para e36">For this reason, I think one of the most interesting effects of the digital
                        humanities upon academic job roles is the pressure it puts on what we think of
                        as our own proper work domains. In the archetypal digital humanities
                        collaboration, traditional faculty explore forms of work that would ordinarily
                        look “technical” or even menial (such as text encoding, metadata creation, or
                        transcription); programmers contribute to editorial decisions; and students
                        coauthor papers with senior scholars in a kind of Bakhtinian carnival of
                        overturned professional usages.

                  </div>
               </div>
            </div>Teaching digital humanists, then, proves challenging because instructors
            must design curricula that do not make strong presuppositions of any form of domain
            knowledge. The best curricula allow for emergent collaborations among practitioners,
            benefiting from and perhaps also relying on the existence of complimentary strengths
            among students. Yet instructors must be careful not to presuppose any central vantage
            point. Inevitably, a curriculum will prove too slack or too demanding, too theoretical
            or too technical, too slanted toward one type of application or another. In such cases,
            teaching depends on the good will of the participants, who assist each other with
            learning concepts from other domains.
         </div>
         <div class="para e38">The lack of presuppositions in the "digital humanities" brings us to a hot button
            issue, namely, whether coding is necessary to the digital humanities. There is a debate
            in the digital humanities community between those who think all digital humanists
            should

            even harmful to scholarly productivity.

            that digital humanities is primarily about building things rather than talking about
            them. As Bethany Nowviskie reminds us, however, the original sense of the "yack" in
            that
            playful phrase was not aimed against academic theoretical analysis, but at wasteful
            committee work that frequently encompasses digital projects in the academy 
            <div class="citation e44" linkend="Nowviskie2014">Nowviskie 2014</div>. The XQuery Institute set out to
            cross this purported divide between builders and sayers in the digital humanities
            with
            as little fanfare as possible. My guiding intuition is that a complementarity exists
            between coding and encoding–by learning to query your markup, you become a more
            proficient encoder. So learning even a bit of programming should prove helpful to
            those
            working on digital markup projects. Of course, establishing this complementarity is
            easier with some programming languages than others, which brings me to XQuery.

         <div class="para e47">I may as well state upfront that I regard XQuery as a fantastic language for digital
            humanists. If you are involved in marking up documents in XML, then learning XQuery
            will
            pay long-term dividends. I do have arguments for this bit of bravado. My reasons for
            lifting up XQuery as a programing language of particular interest to digital humanists
            are essentially three:

               <div class="listitem e53">
                  <div class="para e54">XQuery is compact, terse, and relatively easy to learn.</div>
               </div>
            </div>Let's take each of these points in turn.
         </div>
         <div class="para e55">First, XQuery fits the domain of digital humanists. Admittedly, I am focusing here
            on
            a particular area of the digital humanities, namely the domain of digital text editing
            and analysis. In that domain, however, XQuery proves a nearly perfect match to the
            needs
            of digital humanists.
         </div>
         <div class="para e56">If you scour the online communities related to digital humanities, you will repeatedly
            find conversations about which programming languages to learn. Predictably, the advice
            is all over the map. PHP is easy to learn, readily accessible, and the language of
            many
            popular projects in the digital humanities such as Omeka and Neatline. Javascript
            is
            another obvious choice given its ubiquity. Others recommend Python or Ruby. At the
            margins, you'll find the statistically-inclined recommending R. There are pluses and
            minuses to learning any of these languages. When you are working with XML, however,
            they
            all fall short. Inevitably, working with XML in these languages will require learning
            how to use packages to read XML and convert it to other formats.
         </div>
         <div class="para e57">Learning XQuery eliminates any impedance between data and code. There is no need to
            import any special packages to work with XML. Rather, you can proceed smoothly from
            teaching XML basics to showing how to navigate XML documents with XPath to querying
            XML
            with XQuery. You do not need to jump out of context to teach students about classes,
            objects, tables, or anything as awful-sounding as "shredding" XML documents or storing
            them as "blobs." XQuery makes it possible for students to become productive without
            having to learn as many computer science or software engineering concepts. A simple
            four
            or five line FLWOR expression can easily demonstrate the power of XQuery and provide
            a
            basis for students' tinkering and exploration.
         </div>
         <div class="para e58">Second, XQuery allows for "full-stack" web development. What I mean by this is that
            XQuery can be used in conjunction with native XML databases to develop end-to-end
            web
            applications. This contrasts with other popular approaches, which require aspiring
            developers to learn SQL for interacting with relational databases, maybe to understand
            a
            bit about object-orientation, and to grasp how to express their outputs in HTML, perhaps
            with the help of a templating language. By contrast, it's perfectly feasible to write
            simple interactive web applications just using XQuery and a native XML database.
            Eventually, students will need to learn how to incorporate CSS and JavaScript to improve
            the appearance and usability of their applications. But they can get things off the
            ground without learning anything more than XQuery.
         </div>
         <div class="para e59">A third advantage of XQuery is that it's easy to learn. You wouldn't think this is
            the
            case if you read questions on Stackoverflow. But my suspicion is that the majority
            of
            those who find XQuery perplexing or even execrable have not bothered to learn about
            functional programming and run headlong into brick walls like single-assignment. It
            is
            indeed tough for experienced programmers to switch from imperative, object-oriented
            programming to functional programming. A lot of the idioms and design-patterns are
            just
            different. By contrast, digital humanists are generally learning to program for the
            first time. They don't have to unlearn habits from imperative programming-languages.
            Could Edsger Dijkstra's dictum–"It is practically impossible to teach good programming
            to students that have had a prior exposure to BASIC: as potential programmers they
            are
            mentally mutilated beyond hope of regeneration" 
            <div class="citation e60" linkend="Dykstra1975">Dykstra
               1975
            </div>–actually put digital humanists at an advantage over experienced
            programmers when learning XQuery (substituting BASIC for any imperative or
            object-oriented language)?

                     <div class="para e62">I write this as someone who learned first to program in Applesoft Basic on an
                        Apple II. Dropping line numbering was like losing the scaffolding when I

                  </div>
               </div>
            </div> In a more serious vein, functional programming has the advantage of not
            allowing beginning programmers to "mess up" their data. So long as you stay away from
            extension functions, you can promise students that nothing they do can corrupt their
            data. This brings a certain measure of relief to new programmers, who can "safely"
            explore the standard function library.

         <div class="para e69">Here's a last point about XQuery vis-a-vis other functional programming languages.
            I
            used to refer to XQuery as "functional programming light" prior to Version 3.0. However,
            with support for higher-order functions in XQuery 3.0 and built-in functions mapping
            and
            folding, XQuery stacks up nicely against any other functional programming language
            out
            there. However, that doesn't mean that one should automatically jump into those deep
            waters with beginners.

            </div> In general, functional programming relies heavily on recursion, which is
            notoriously difficult for non-programmers to master. By contrast, FLWOR expressions

            it possible to write many expressions without using recursion.

            on
            XPath by Debbie Lapeyre and XQuery by Jason Hunter. Suffice it to say, the combination
            of these sessions persuaded me that we should switch out digital library platform
            from
            .NET to MarkLogic. The Princeton Theological Seminary Library purchased a license
            for a
            standard edition of the MarkLogic in June 2007. In July, our metadata librarian and
            I
            took a three day "Introduction to MarkLogic Server: Developer Course." We worked with
            MarkLogic Professional Services to rewrite our digital library platform from C# and

            <div class="para e86">The immediate impetus for our XQuery training series at Princeton Theological
               Seminary arose from the practical need to involve more staff members in digital
               library projects. We had aspirations of building a large-scale digital library and
               we did not want to outsource its development to others. However, we also had a
               larger vision of helping our library staff members transition from traditional
               cataloging practices to modes of work more suited to large-scale digital production.
               Christine Schwartz, who was the head cataloger at the time, and I had many lengthy
               conversations about the future direction of the library profession. As the Network
               Standards Office at the Library of Congress promoted new XML metadata standards such
               as MARCXML, METS, MIX, MODS, etc., we foresaw that catalogers would need to develop
               new skill sets to work with these XML formats. So our broader aim was to train
               librarians in XML and XQuery with the hope of reinventing at least some of our
               cataloging and descriptive processes.
            </div>
            <div class="para e87">We arranged for Priscilla Walmsley to provide our initial introduction to XQuery.
               Walmsley led a three day workshop in Princeton on November 12-14, 2008. Her workshop
               introduced our staff to XQuery and to the essentials of MarkLogic. But, like any
               training course, there is only so much you can absorb in a short amount of time. The
               key to learning anything is practice over time.
            </div>
            <div class="para e88">So we gathered a small group of staff members during the week following Walmsley's
               training course to plan what became a weekly XQuery seminar. The group included me,
               our Christian education librarian, collection development librarian, head cataloger,
               manuscript librarian, and technical services librarian. We met at 11:00 a.m. every
               Friday morning for an hour-long session. As a textbook for the class, we adopted Ron

               worked through practical exercises with an eye toward addressing typical library
               problems. For example, our first session covered how to gather metadata from journal
               articles and package them for submission as DOIs to CrossRef. Other sessions
               addressed how to interact with the WorldCat API using XQuery and how to generate RSS
               feeds of newly-ingested metadata. Our focus was not entirely practical, though. We
               introduced concepts like recursion (with the Towers of Hanoi) and higher-order
               functions (using the MarkLogic implementation predating XQuery 3.0). In the
               beginning, I led most of the sessions. As participants gained experience with
               XQuery, they took turns leading sessions. 
            </div>
            <div class="para e91">The outcome of these sessions was generally positive. One of the participants
               transitioned from her position in the technical services department to our digital
               library team. Another member subsequently became the ScrumMaster for the digital
               team. As we expanded our digital team, the sessions proved crucial for onboarding
               new members. (It's basically impossible to recruit librarians with prior knowledge
               of XQuery.) Other participants in the sessions learned enough XQuery to carry out
               basic metadata tasks. Even those who did not actively incorporate XQuery into their
               daily work gained a new appreciation for its role in our digital library. From
               another perspective, then, the sessions strengthened staff support for our digital
               library program as a whole.
            </div>
            <div class="para e92">I am glad to report that after a hiatus these sessions have resumed at the
               Princeton Seminary Library. Interestingly, the focus is now primarily on XSLT since
               most of the team members have sufficiently mastered XQuery.

            <div class="para e95">In spring 2014, David Michelson and I co-taught a graduate-level seminar at
               Vanderbilt University titled "Topics in Digital Humanities: Introduction to Digital

               School at Vanderbilt with an affiliated appointment in Classics. The initiative for
               our course arose from the desire to offer a version of the curriculum we had
               proposed for the XQuery Summer Institute (described below) to graduate students on
               campus. Eight students registered for the course along with a number of auditors,
               including several librarians.

            <div class="para e111">We set a very ambitious agenda for our class. We presupposed no knowledge of XML
               or any programming language. After imparting the basics of XML, we taught students
               how to encode humanities texts in simple TEI. From there, we moved to XPath and then
               to XQuery. We asked students to install eXist and populate a collection with XML
               documents relevant to their areas of research. Finding relevant datasets turned out
               to be the largest problem. In the field of art history, for example, it turned out
               to be surprisingly difficult to locate open access VRA Core datasets in XML. After
               the mid-semester break, we began teaching sessions on various useful techniques in
               XQuery. For example, we showed students how to generate web pages for their datasets
               using a recursive typeswitch expression.

            </div>
            <div class="para e121">We designed the course so that students would come away with an array of
               computational techniques for analyzing documents in their own fields. My
               co-instructor, David Michelson, was particularly concerned that students grapple
               with how the digital humanities could enhance their own evolving research agendas.
               He asked participants to write a brief "implementation plan," indicating their
               aspirations for their future work in the digital humanities and how they intended
               to
               deepen their expertise in order to meet their short-term and long-term goals.
            </div>
            <div class="para e122">We offered students the option of writing a traditional paper for their final
               project, but everybody elected to submit a hybrid final consisting of a digital
               project along with a critical reflection. The students' projects were uniformly
               excellent, demonstrating genuine creativity in the application of the techniques we
               imparted to their various fields of study.
            </div>
            <div class="para e123">Of course, we also came away with ideas about how to improve the course. The first
               and perhaps most obvious point is that the traditional model of the humanities
               seminar is not the optimal way to teach a digital humanities course, at least not
               one focused on teaching XQuery. A typical graduate seminar in the humanities meets
               weekly for several hours; students spend the week in between classes working through
               assigned readings, which tend to be fairly heavy. This pattern does not function
               well when you are teaching a programming language. While many students took
               advantage of our office hours, we should have held practice sessions during the
               week. As with learning any new language, the key is practice and an intensive
               seminar once a week does not work as well as shorter but more frequent sessions. We
               should also have assigned students more programming challenges. We asked students
               to
               turn in a number of written reflections on the assigned readings over the course of
               the semester, but we did not assign many programming exercises. Again, it's fairly
               obvious in retrospect that working through problem sets would have helped students
               master difficult techniques in XQuery.
            </div>
            <div class="para e124">On the positive side, we largely succeeded in our ambitious goal of teaching XML,
               TEI, XPath, XQuery, and eXist in a single semester course. We knew going in that our
               students had varying backgrounds in the digital humanities. We did not expect those
               who were completely new to the digital humanities to master all these technologies.
               We hoped simply that they would gain an appreciation for their possibilities and
               acquire a solid foundation for future growth. Students with more advanced
               backgrounds applied their new-found knowledge to complex questions in their domains
               of expertise, demonstrating in their final presentations just how powerful the
               combination of these technologies can be.

               other characteristics, every word, punctuation character, and space in the digital
               texts is marked up with an XML:ID. We had the fortunate opportunity during the
               institute to speak with Rebecca Niles and Michael Poston at the Folger Library to
               discuss their encoding decisions. An interesting feature of the institute was the
               opportunity it afforded to look at these texts from different perspectives, i.e.
               from encoding to querying to indexing in eXist. We all came away with a much
               stronger sense of the tradeoffs made in different contexts.
            </div>
            <div class="para e138">In the second half of the first week, Jonathan Robie introduced XPath and XQuery.
               As you all know, Robie is the lead editor of the XPath and XQuery Recommendations
               at
               the W3C. He is also a wonderful instructor. Among the many points Robie made during
               the institute is that encoding and querying should be considered complimentary
               activities. The best way to mark up documents is to encode, query, and repeat–in
               other words, to work iteratively rather than serially from markup to application.
               Robie finished the week by demonstrating the analytic power of new constructs in
               XQuery 3.0 such as windowing for digital humanities research.
            </div>
            <div class="para e139">Whereas the first week concentrated on the XQuery language itself, the second week
               was devoted to its implementation in eXist. Winona Salesky, an independent library
               consultant, and Kevin S. Clarke, Digital Library Programmer at the University of
               California Los Angeles, led most of the second week. Salesky and Clarke built a
               sample "browse and search" application for the Folger Digital Texts.

               Model-View-Controller (MVC) applications, to writing test suites for modules. Dale
               Poulter, coordinator of search and core services, showed us how to deploy our sample

               the two weeks of the institute, we had a wonderful time together and covered a very
               large amount of ground. A key to the success of the institute was our use of
               pair-programming. As we alternated between lectures and hands-on exercises, we asked
               participants to partner with each other to try out techniques and to talk through
               any problems together. We also rotated these pairings daily. This technique ensured
               that nobody became ineluctably stuck while attempting the exercises. Our informal
               motto for the institute was "No digital humanist left behind!"

            <div class="para e144">The diversity of the participants modeled the diversity of real world digital
               humanities projects. During our two weeks, we addressed nearly every angle of
               creating a digital humanities project 
               <div class="emphasis e145">in nuce</div>, from
               articulating research questions to building full-fledged applications. Individual
               participants arrived with stronger background in some areas than others. By
               collaborating throughout the two weeks, we all gained greater appreciation for these
               different aspects–from the challenge of articulating a research agenda in the
               digital humanities to what goes into building and deploying web applications for
               digital humanities projects. The pacing of the institute would have been different
               if we had invited only faculty or librarians to apply. Inevitably, some thought we
               moved too quickly and others too slowly through certain portions of our agenda. But
               the diversity of our group mirrored the diversity of the "big tent" of the digital
               humanities. We are grateful to the Office of Digital Humanities for affording an
               all-too-rare opportunity to provide an educational event encompassing participants
               from all disciplines under that "big tent."

         <div class="title e147">Obstacles for Digital Humanists</div>
         <div class="para e148">What are the unique challenges of teaching XQuery to digital humanists? I think we
            can
            extrapolate at least three hurdles digital humanists face when seeking to learn
            XQuery.
         </div>
         <div class="para e149">The first is simply gaining a vision for the place of programming in their
            scholarship. Why make the effort to learn to program? Is that not a step outside the
            humanities into a foreign, and sometimes hostile, world? Is it not better to leave
            programming to the experts? The move from word processing to markup languages is far
            more incremental than the leap from encoding to coding. The current enthusiasm for
            digital humanities has perhaps lessened this line of concern. Still, the questions
            remain pertinent given the demands on scholars' time.
         </div>
         <div class="para e150">Teaching XQuery to digital humanists requires helping them envision how their new
            skills and insights will advance their scholarship. We cannot assume any intrinsic
            motivation to learn programming for its own sake. This renders the majority of the
            standard teaching materials for programmers problematic, at least as standalone
            documents. Most programming manuals assume that readers are already motived to learn
            a
            given technology and, after perhaps a few paragraphs about its power and usefulness,
            immediately jump into the details. For digital humanists, a better approach would
            be to
            explain general concepts with reference to concrete research problems. For instance,
            using XQuery to interact with RESTful APIs might be learned in the context of teaching
            digital humanists how to use the Alchemy API to carry out sentiment analysis on their
            texts.
         </div>
         <div class="para e151">A second major challenge is that most digital humanists encounter XQuery without any
            background in computer science or software engineering. This makes for humorous
            "namespace" conflicts with natural language. While teaching the XQuery Summer Institute,
            we began keeping an informal list of technical terms in XQuery that have natural
            language cognates: evaluate, expression, predicate, etc. Even technical slang like
            "grok" needs explanation. David Michelson played our "faculty Luddite" role during
            the institute.
            <div class="popupBox e152">
               <div class="popupLabel" onmouseover="$('#d1e308').show('1000');" onmouseout="$('#d1e308').hide('1000');">[ footnote ]</div>
               <div id="d1e308" style="display: none;">
                  <div class="footnote">
                     <div class="para e153">For the record, Dave numbers among the most sophisticated digital
                        humanists.
                     </div>
                  </div>
               </div>
            </div> Whenever an unexplained term popped up, Michelson would request an
            explanation on behalf of the group. His role was important because, as technical terms
            piled up, participants tended to defer questions or pass over them altogether.
         </div>
         <div class="para e154">Of course, just defining terms only gets you so far. The primary issue was filling
            in
            the necessary background knowledge. Digital humanities can be more demanding than
            traditional computer science courses. Whereas there is a recommended sequence of courses
            in computer science programs, which introduce and then deepen a body of knowledge
            over
            time, digital humanities courses and training sessions generally presuppose little
            to
            nothing. Digital humanists must frequently tackle new concepts like typing and scoping
            while also learning new computational techniques.
         </div>
         <div class="para e155">A related issue is that few digital humanists have experience with software
            engineering. Training resources for XQuery frequently assume readers have experience
            with common tools like relational databases, making analogies to SQL and relational
            tables, for example, when explaining joins in XQuery. This assumption makes perfect
            sense when teaching technologists but it doesn't work for digital humanists since
            you'll
            inevitably need to explain how a relational database functions for them to get the
            analogy. Best practices like using source control and writing unit tests also require
            clarification.
            <div class="popupBox e156">
               <div class="popupLabel" onmouseover="$('#d1e316').show('1000');" onmouseout="$('#d1e316').hide('1000');">[ footnote ]</div>
               <div id="d1e316" style="display: none;">
                  <div class="footnote">
                     <div class="para e157">I've led digital humanities sessions, for instance, that have devolved into
                        teaching git rather than the technology at stake.
                     </div>
                  </div>
               </div>
            </div> This problem becomes especially acute when digital humanists aspire to build
            systems for the project. Broadly speaking, the divide between librarians and faculty
            becomes wider here. Librarians frequently do need to develop systems and will thus
            need
            to master the myriad of software engineering practices and tools. Many faculty members
            will experience software engineering as a domain of diminishing returns. An effective
            digital humanities center or campus network will connect faculty to developers when
            they
            are ready to build production systems for their projects.
         </div>
         <div class="para e158">A third challenge is that digital humanists frequently need to push beyond the
            boundaries of XQuery for the purposes of their research. In our digital humanities
            class
            at Vanderbilt, for example, we wanted to reproduce some of the analytical techniques
            that Matthew Jockers discusses in 
            <div class="emphasis e159">Macroanalysis: Digital Methods and Literary
               History
            </div>. As far as I am aware, there is no statistical library for
            XQuery. So we demonstrated how to use XQuery to gather data from documents and then
            how
            to import that data into R for statistical analysis. While the combination of XQuery
            and
            the R programming language is potentially extraordinarily powerful, switching contexts
            between the languages proved too difficult. We did not have sufficient time to introduce
            R, RStudio, ggplot2, etc. and the students who tried to incorporate this technique
            into
            their final projects were not successful. If XQuery had a data analysis library akin
            to
            Python's 
            <div class="emphasis e160">pandas</div>,

            </div> for instance, it would be easier for them to use XQuery to produce the kind
            of digital text analysis that many have in mind when contemplating computational
            applications. Recent work bridging XQuery and SPARQL is promising because a significant
            number of digital humanities projects include a network analysis component. 
            <div class="citation e164" linkend="Cagle2011">See, e.g., Cagle 2011</div> Enriching the XQuery ecosystem
            with libraries to carry out basic "digital humanities" functionality would help to
            make
            the language more accessible. eXist leads the way in this respect with its package
            system, incorporating such useful packages as the Stanford Named Entity
            Recognizer.

            for digital humanists.
         </div>
         <div class="para e168">First, we need to develop instructional materials for digital humanists. In general,
            the materials for learning XQuery are few compared to other programming languages,
            reflecting no doubt its level of usage in the general technology community. We may
            be
            thankful for Priscilla Walmsley's

            has reached recommendation status. We may also be grateful that Erik Siegel and Adam
            Retter are currently writing a book for O'Reilly on eXist; it's already an extremely
            valuable resource in its "rough cuts" format.

            the literature for introducing beginners to XQuery and XML databases. The excellent
            XQuery Wikibook provides a bunch of really useful examples of XQuery in action.

            </div> What's needed is a textbook for use in digital humanities workshops and
            classrooms. Crucially, the sample applications in this proposed textbook should center
            on narrative documents and, for the most part, avoid mathematical examples. In other
            words, if you plan to teach recursion, build an algorithm to validate palindromes
            rather
            than solve the Fibonacci sequence.
         </div>
         <div class="para e177">Another way to improve the accessibility of XQuery would be to encourage the sharing
            of datasets and code. As mentioned, the students in our digital humanities seminar
            at
            Vanderbilt experienced difficulty finding open datasets in some fields of the
            humanities. The problem is especially acute in art history but there is a lot less
            TEI
            on GitHub than you might expect. (There are, of course, many notable exceptions.)
            Libraries and other cultural institutions that produce TEI should adopt a default
            policy
            of sharing their data under Creative Commons licenses. The same point applies,
            
            <div class="emphasis e178">ceteris paribus</div>, to sharing code. Sharing examples of XQuery on
            GitHub or just as Gists can really prove helpful to those getting started.

         <div class="para e183">A final recommendation is more ambitious. My hope is to integrate XPath and XQuery
            into the teaching of TEI and other markup standards in the digital humanities community.
            As Jonathan Robie indicated during our XQuery Institute, encoding and coding should
            be
            complimentary, iterative activities. More strongly put, the full implications of digital
            encoding do not become apparent until scholars learn to reorder, remix, and rework
            their
            texts computationally. We all know the effort involved in marking up a text in TEI.
            If
            the end goal is simply to transform the marked up document into HTML or PDF for
            publication on the web, then we cannot expect scholars to continue to make that
            investment of time over the long run. By providing scholars with the computational
            tools
            to analyze their documents, we repay their efforts to encode them. Moreover, teaching
            XQuery alongside TEI would benefit scholars' understanding of markup, allowing them
            deepened insight into why particular encoding decisions might be more or less efficient
            for particular purposes.
         </div>
         <div class="para e184">What would this new method of teaching TEI look like? The syllabus has yet to be
            worked out. However, I imagine that the basics of the approach could be accomplished
            in
            three day workshops, which aimed less at building systems with XQuery than at providing
            a sufficient introduction to the language for digital humanists to commence an iterative
            process of encoding and querying. Where they go from there would be up to them–as
            with
            any programming language, there are no limits on where XQuery can take them.

         <div class="title e186">Conclusion</div>
         <div class="para e187">The pressures on XML as a markup standard in the general community of technologists
            also exist in the digital humanities, though in more muted fashion. While most digital
            humanists working on textual projects continue to work in XML, they interact with
            librarians and other technologists who have increasingly turned to JSON to transfer
            data
            across the wire. From my perspective, the digital humanists would be impoverished
            if
            leaders in the digital humanities community sought to rewrite TEI in JSON. What would
            that project look like? More likely, digital humanists might just give up on marking
            up
            documents in favor of conducting statistical analyses on datasets of unstructured
            texts.
            If we wish to avoid this future and preserve a place in the digital humanities for
            the
            kind of critical editions that XML markup affords, it behooves us to assist scholars
            with climbing up the XML value chain–from mastering XML languages like TEI to learning
            analytical technologies like XPath and XQuery.
