         <div class="para e39">Last year at Balisage (2009) we explored the claim that documents, in the sense of
            repeatable symbolic expressions, cannot undergo any genuine change or modification[
            <div class="xref e40" linkend="renear09"></div>]. This is a claim obviously in direct contradiction to the common assumption that
            documents routinely undergo a wide variety of changes, such as revision, editing,
            and reformatting. The modification of documents is in fact an integral part of publishing
            workflows and so at the heart of many activities of professional interest to Balisage
            participants. Not surprisingly one comment on last year's presentation was: "You are
            telling me that my profession is impossible".

         <div class="title e52">The Arguments</div>
         <div class="para e53">The word "document" has, of course, many senses. Our informal characterization of
            the sense intended in "Documents cannot be modified" is 
            <div class="emphasis e54" role="ital">repeatable symbolic expression</div>. This seems to be more or less the same sense implied in the XML specification, which
            defines "XML Document" as a string that matches certain formal constraints [
            <div class="xref e55" linkend="xml08"></div>]. It also corresponds closely to the concept of an "expression" in the "Functional
            Requirements for Bibliographic Records" (FRBR) [
            <div class="xref e56" linkend="frbr98"></div>] and to some uses of the word "text" in textual philology [
            <div class="xref e57" linkend="tanselle89"></div>]. A document in this sense is not an individual physical object[
            <div class="xref e58" linkend="buckland97"></div>]  but the symbolic structure that can be found simultaneously instantiated in multiple
            physical objects [
            <div class="xref e59" linkend="derose90"></div>].
         </div>
         <div class="para e60">We motivated the claim that documents cannot be modified in several ways: 
            <div class="popupBox e61">
               <div class="popupLabel" onmouseover="$('#d1e106').show('1000');" onmouseout="$('#d1e106').hide('1000');">[ footnote ]</div>
               <div id="d1e106" style="display: none;">
                  <div class="footnote">
                     <div class="para e62">Please see the account presented last year for a more detailed presentation.[
                        <div class="xref e63" linkend="renear09"></div>]. See also  
                        <div class="xref e64" linkend="renear08"></div> and

                  </div>
               </div>
            </div>
         </div>
         <div class="para e66">First, we noted that digital documents, like all digital objects, are typically defined
            in terms of mathematical entities such as strings, tuples, relations, functions, and
            graphs. All of these entities are in turn defined as kinds of sets and, consequently,
            all are extensional: a set cannot, strictly speaking, lose or gain members, and therefore
            similar constraints will apply to those entities that are defined as kinds of sets,
            such as strings, tuples, relations, functions, and graphs. A string for instance cannot
            lose or gain a substring, a tuple cannot lose or gain an element, a relation cannot
            lose or gain a tuple, and so on. These constraints are consequences of all standard
            axiomatizations of mathematical set theory. Of course we can say that a string S was
            transformed into another string S', but this is an idiom -- there is no underlying
            thing that once was identical with S and now is identical with S', as genuine modification
            requires. Editing strings is mapping from one string to another, not modifying a persistent
            underlying entity. 
         </div>
         <div class="para e67">Second, we also observed more generally that abstract objects, and not just mathematical
            objects or digital objects, appear to have their non-relational properties essentially
            -- and so have no non-relational properties that they can lose. Since modification
            requires losing or gaining a non-relational property (ceasing to be thought about
            by John is not genuine modification) this means that abstract objects generally, and
            not just mathematical objects or digital objects, cannot undergo modification.
         </div>
         <div class="para e68">Finally we observed that documents, in the sense intended, are in fact explicitly
            treated as immutable by communities with fairly practical non-philosophical objectives,
            such as catalogers [
            <div class="xref e69" linkend="frbr98"></div>], textual philologists [
            <div class="xref e70" linkend="tanselle89"></div>], and, in at least some contexts, XML specialists.

         <div class="para e73">Because the claim that documents cannot be modified contradicts commonly held beliefs
            to the contrary the arguments just presented can be seen as presenting us with a puzzle,
            a conflict in our commonsense pre-theoretical beliefs. To systematically explore the
            various responses to this puzzle, we surveyed the alternative strategies for resolving

         <div class="para e83">Responses to an inconsistent triad must reject one (at least) of the assertions in
            the triad and may be classified according to which assertion is rejected. Each class
            of responses has a distinctive burden. Responses rejecting the first assertion preserve
            our intuition that documents can be modified, but must provide an alternative account
            of what documents are, since they are not strings, graphs, or other immutable abstract
            entities. Responses rejecting the third assertion typically retain familiar definitions
            of document as immutable objects, but to be convincing they must provide a plausible
            account of what apparent document modification really is, since it cannot be genuine
            modification. Because there appeared to be very little that could be said in defense
            of rejecting the second assertion (extensional or abstract objects, such as strings,
            cannot undergo genuine modification) we focused primarily on responses that rejected
            the first or third assertions. 
         </div>
         <div class="para e84">We found responses that reject the first assertion to be fairly unpersuasive. They
            required admitting rather challenging ontological entities (e.g. "social objects")
            and relationships (e.g. "constitution"), and even given these entities and relationships
            it is not clear how a useful formal account of document change and identity could
            be developed [
            <div class="xref e85" linkend="cantwellsmith96"></div>,  [
            <div class="xref e86" linkend="smith03"></div>]. 
         </div>
         <div class="para e87">This seemed to tip the balance in favor of responses that reject the third assertion:
            documents can be modified. However a satisfying response here must avoid additional
            counterintuitive consequences, such as documents that exist before persons, or abstract
            objects that come into existence outside of the causal framework of natural science.
            We concluded, adapting the theory of social facts developed by John Searle [
            <div class="xref e88" linkend="searle95"></div>], that the least objectionable solution to the puzzle is that a document is indeed
            an unmodifiable string (or some other similarly extensional or abstract object) in
            a particular communicative role which it has in virtue of contingent social and linguistic
            circumstances.
         </div>
         <div class="para e89">To meet the burden of providing an alternative account of modification we suggested
            that what is commonly referred to as the modification of a document might be understood
            as a person or persons coming to prefer one string to another for a particular communication
            task, and, typically, recording this intention in an information processing system
            or through some other physical medium. To the extent that our common discourse suggests
            that there is some thing, some real object, that is genuinely modified, this manner
            of speaking is not to be taken literally, but as some sort of idiom, metaphor, or
            "logical construction", perhaps similar to sentences such as "the sun rose in the
            east," or "the average plumber has 3.2 children". Such sentences can be true, but
            they cannot be literally true, in the sense of having a compositional semantics and
            directly (without rephrasing) supporting existential instantiation and valid inference.
            Of course this cannot be a complete account of apparent change, since it does not
            give explain "communicative role" in terms that would account for intuitions of apparent
            sameness in some circumstances of changing preferences, but it nevertheless seemed
            like a promising direction to explore.
         </div>
         <div class="para e90">We were under no illusion as to whether we had succeeded in demonstrating that this
            particular resolution was decisively superior to the others, however we did believe
            that we had at least accomplished a breadth-first survey of the general kinds of responses
            that could be made to the triad. So it came as a surprise to realize that we had left
            one out.

         <div class="para e94">Other then pure intellectual curiosity, why should anyone be interested in such a
            strange and abstruse meditation as we presented last year at Balisage, and now correct

         </div>
         <div class="para e95">We believe that there is a case to be made that reflections of this sort are indeed
            relevant to the design of information management systems. Inferencing over formal
            ontologies is increasingly important in information processing, but systematically
            making information available in logic-based ontology languages requires that the assertions
            we wish to record be expressed in languages that allow only literal interpretation.
            Human beings may effectively communicate with natural language sentences such as "The
            sun rose in the east", "An fog of anxiety descended upon the congregation", "The average
            plumber has 3.2 children", or "The document was edited". But to support inferencing
            in the semantic web environment these idioms must be converted to assertions in languages
            that rely on compositional semantics, existential instantiation, and valid deductive
            consequences. The underlying ontology need not reflect the latest theories of modern
            physics, but it should nevertheless at least be internally consistent, and as much
            as possible avoid clashes with commonsense beliefs. A naive formalization of our familiar
            discourse about documents does not meet these requirements.

         <div class="para e99">This spring (2010) at the Graduate School of Library and Information Science, University
            of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, we held a seminar titled "Identity and Change in
            Information Systems", focusing on issues related to formalizing our understanding
            of digital objects, particularly with respect to representing how they are created
            and reidentified, and what sort of changes they may undergo. In the course of reviewing
            prior relevant work on the topic of identity and change we considered a philosophical
            position, (physical object) eliminativism, which resolves traditional puzzles about
            change by arguing that ordinary physical objects do not really exist.
         </div>
         <div class="para e100">Consider the staple problem of "material constitution". A statue S consists of a quantity
            of bronze B. In unguarded moments we are probably inclined to say that the statue
            and the quantity (mass, lump, etc.) of bronze are identical. After all they are in
            the same place at the same time and consist of the same stuff (and not just the same
            kind of stuff, but the very same stuff, the very same bits of bronze), and appear
            to have the same causal effects and powers. But problems with this identification
            ensue. 
         </div>
         <div class="para e101">For one thing if the statue was created this morning from an already existing lump
            of bronze then the statue has a property that the bronze does not have: 
            <div class="emphasis e102" role="ital">being created this morning</div>. And so the statue apparently can't be the very same thing as the lump of bronze.
            [On the general principle, sometimes known as Leibnit's Law, or the indiscerniblity
            of identicals, that if x and y are identical then x has all the properties y has.]

         <div class="para e103">Or imagine that our statue S (let's say it is a statue of a horse) is melted and reshaped
            into another statue, S' (a statue of a person). No bronze was lost so the lump of
            bronze, B, that was earlier identical with S continues to exist and is now identical
            with S'. But identity is transitive and so S, the statue of the horse, is identical
            with S', the statue of a person, -- which seems false.
         </div>
         <div class="para e104">There are many more puzzles of this sort and many different approaches to resolving
            them. One rather extreme response is to deny that there are statues and instead to
            hold that there are just quantities of bronze which have particular properties that
            they can gain and lose. If the adjective were not already used with a different meaning
            we could say that some bronze can gain and lose the property of being "statuesque"
            [
            <div class="xref e105" linkend="chisholm76"></div>]. Or alternatively one can say that the bronze can be "arranged statuewise" [

         </div>
         <div class="para e107">The view that things of some familiar kind do not really exist is called "eliminativism"
            in philosophy. From the eliminativist's point some parts of our commonsense "folk
            ontology" are inconsistent, mistaken, or redundant, and need to be replaced with a
            more accurate conceptualization, one in which some of the familiar things in that
            ontology will have no role.  Sometimes the motivation for eliminativism is the view
            that contemporary science, typically physics, provides a much different and much better
            account of our world than our folk concepts do. Physicists for instance have routinely
            claimed that 20th century physics shows that our ordinary concepts of time, space,
            causality, and physical objects are flawed. One response to these new physical theories
            is to integrate the findings of physics into our commonsense ontology, which leads
            to assertions such as: tables are really wave functions.  This however is not eliminativism,
            but 
            <div class="emphasis e108" role="ital">reductionism</div>, as it reduces tables to other things but does not eliminate tables from the scientific
            view of the world -- on the contrary, the existence of the folk object is confirmed
            not denied in the reduction.
         </div>
         <div class="para e109">The eliminativist on the other hand is not concerned to provide a more accurate and
            up-to-date understanding of what tables are, but rather to eliminate tables from our
            commonsense ontology altogether. The eliminativist claims that with respect to some
            fragment of our commonsense ontology (in this case medium-sized physical objects)
            it is not possible to map the concepts in that fragment, concept by concept, into
            the scientific alternative. Instead the scientific alternative must simply replace,
            entirely, the relevant portion of our folk ontology.  The eliminativist will hold
            that there is nothing in the real world, as revealed by modern physics, that corresponds
            closely enough to our concept of table to be appropriately considered a table, and
            that modern physics will allow us to say all there is to say about how things are
            in the kitchen without implying that there is a table in the room. Eliminativists
            argue that the objects of our commonsense notions are not just poorly understood,
            but that the concepts are too flawed to correspond to anything in the current scientific
            world view.

                        differently. Eliminativists will typically need to provide a syntactically different
                        replacement for an ordinary sentence they that they consider in its entirety to be
                        an idiom.  Reductionists can sometimes expand a particular word or expression in place,

            a response to specific puzzles that reveal a conflict of commonsense intuitions. The
            problem of material constitution (the statue and the bronze) is an example. Other
            puzzles motivating recent eliminativism with respect to physical objects include those
            based on the vagueness of identity conditions for certain objects [
            <div class="xref e113" linkend="chisholm76"></div>, [
            <div class="xref e114" linkend="unger79"></div>], the unclarity of when it is that two objects are parts of a third thing [

            <div class="xref e116" linkend="merricks01"></div>]. The eliminativist claims that these puzzles demonstrate the deep incoherence of
            our ordinary (folk) views and argue that an eliminative resolution is the best recourse
            available: completely replace our ordinary notions with an alternative system of concepts.
            Eliminativist arguments are surveyed and criticised in Thomasson [

            this would allow us both to avoid accepting obscure social objects into our ontology
            and also to avoid endorsing the counterintuitive claim that documents cannot be modified.

            in an interpretation (an assignment of objects to predicates) if and only if nothing
            in that interpretatin both satisfies the antecedent and fails to satisfy the consequent.
            This entails that a universally quantified conditional will be true in all interpretations
            where nothing satisfies the antecedent -- regardless of what the consequent is. An
            odd and awkward result perhaps (it is one of the so-called "paradoxes" of material
            implication), but a common feature of first order logic nonetheless. As a consequence
            of this, in an interpretation where nothing is a document this set of assertions would

                     <div class="para e163">Given the usual semantics of modal logic the fact that an interpretation has no documents
                        does not itself entail that 1) and 3) are true in that interpretation, even though
                        it does entail that the non-modal components of those formula (e.g., (x)[(isaDocument(x)-&gt;isModifiable(x)])
                        are true in that interpretation. The modalized formula is only true if there is no
                        other interpretation where the non-modal portion of that assertion is true, that is
                        to say, no interpretation that has a modifiable document. So with the modalization
                        we do avoid consistency based on the trivial satisfaction of the conditional in an
                        interpretation with no documents. 
                     </div>
                     <div class="para e164">However this does not materially change the problem. The modal triad is indeed inconsistent
                        if there are interpretations where documents (and strings) exist, but the existence
                        of such interpretations, or "possible worlds", is precisely what is in dispute. If
                        we treat the predicates in our argument as logically opaque atoms that may be arbitrarily
                        assigned to objects in an interpretation, then of course there will be interpretations
                        where "isaDocument(x)" is assigned to an object, and which we might casually describe
                        as interpretations where documents exist. But document eliminativism is not a view
                        about the combinatoric possibilities for assigning objects to predicates; document
                        eliminativism holds that there are no documents in any genuinely possible world. And
                        if there are no documents in any possible world then the first and third modalized
                        assertions are true in every possible world, for that reason alone the triad is consistent.

         <div class="para e167">If there are no documents our puzzle is resolved. And this is itself perhaps a reason
            to believe that there are no documents. But it is not much of a reason. To be preferred
            to other solutions to the document modifiability puzzle the position that there are
            no documents must have genuine advantages over those other approaches, and perhaps
            some independent positive rationale as well. Let's see what can be provided along
            those lines.
         </div>
         <div class="para e168">We begin by realleging the results of last year's paper. Solutions to the modifiability
            puzzle that reject the first assertion (documents are strings) and redefine document
            as a social object, seem to us to be fairly unpromising, for the reasons given before.

                        objects, is both profoundly at odds with common discourse and unpromising as a solution
                        to the puzzle in any event, as we argued in 2009.

            While not decisive, this might nevertheless be seen a providing at least some evidence
            in favor of the alternative, solutions that reject the third assertion -- though of
            course this prima facie warrant will be defeated if rejecting the third assertion
            turns out to have consequences even more obscure or counterintuitive than rejecting
            the first.
         </div>
         <div class="para e171">In last year's paper we argued that although not every way of rejecting the third
            assertion was plausible, there was in fact a coherent position that rejected the third
            assertion and slightly qualified the first. This approach defined a document as a
            string in a contingent social role. Documents, being strings, are not modifiable on
            this account, but document modification discourse could be understood not as expressing
            literal truths, but rather consisting of harmless idioms and logical fictions that
            can be paraphrased into more precise representations.
         </div>
         <div class="para e172">But we now know that there are two ways to reject the third assertion: (i) no modifiable
            documents, and (ii) no documents at all . So before preferring "no modifiable documents"
            to "no documents at all" we ought to see what there is to say in favor of "no documents".
         </div>
         <div class="para e173">Obviously it is commonly believed that documents can be revised, edited, shortened,
            lengthened, and modified in other ways. This belief is widespread, and deeply rooted.
            It is perhaps so deeply rooted that it may be an integral part of our concept of what
            a document is, so intrinsic to the concept that perhaps that nothing can be document
            if it is not modifiable.
         </div>
         <div class="para e174">Consider this example from the philosophical literature on the semantics of natural
            kind terms [
            <div class="xref e175" linkend="kripke81"></div>]. We have beliefs about tigers. If some of these beliefs are wrong (say we believe
            tigers never have more than two kittens at a time, when in fact they often have more
            than two) then we are mistaken in believing such things about tigers -- but we are
            still believing something about tigers, even if it is something that isn't true. Now
            suppose we discover that tigers are not at all what we thought they were, that they
            aren't mammals for instance, or perhaps not even animals. Suppose they turn out to
            be robots. Should we really say "tigers are robots"? Intuitions here vary. Suppose
            it turns out that tiger experiences are being created by sophisticated multi-modal
            holograms. When we find this out would we say "we now know what tigers really are
            -- they are holograms"? Or would we say "Well, well, looks like there are no tigers
            after all, just holograms", or, in a similar vein, "what we thought were tigers are
            in fact holograms". Of course we might still open with "Tigers are holograms; who
            knew?", which suggests that there are tigers, and those tigers are holograms. But
            even if we said that casually, would it really be literally true? Wouldn't it be more
            accurate to say, after reflection, that 
            <div class="emphasis e176" role="ital">there are no tigers, that what we thought were tigers are only holograms. </div>
         </div>
         <div class="para e177">Perhaps being modifiable is to our concept of a document what being a living organism
            is to our concept of tiger. If so we could represent this conceptual fact, while maintaining
            neutrality on the question of whether there are documents, by the conditional: "if
            there are documents then they are modifiable"

            </div>. But in 2009 we presented arguments to the conclusion that documents are not modifiable.
            From those two assertions, by 
            <div class="emphasis e181" role="ital">modus tollens</div>, the conclusion "There are no documents" follows. The argument, in short, is:

         <div class="orderedlist e182">
            <div class="listitem e183">
               <div class="para e184">There are no modifiable documents</div>

            </div>
         </div>
         <div class="para e189">This argument should be taken seriously even if one is skeptical of either (or both)
            of the two premises. This is because there is some supporting argumentation for each
            of those premises and, apparently, no decisive arguments against them. The support
            for the first premise is our argument last year that the unpromising nature of social
            objects as a way out of the modifiability puzzle provides at least some evidence,
            though not conclusive, for immutable documents.  Supporting the second premise is
            the widespread and deeply held belief that documents are modifiable.  The claim here
            is not that these considerations are sufficient to justify accepting the conclusion
            ("There are no documents"), but rather that they seem to shift the burden of proof
            to anyone who wishes to deny the conclusion and claim that there are documents.

            advantage do we get by the strange tortured refusal to accept the existence ordinary
            things, especially if it is allowed that those things aren't at all what they seem
            to be?
         </div>
         <div class="para e223">The answer to "what do we get?" is presumably: a simple consistent ontology that is
            free of both puzzles and obscure entities and preserves as many important commonsense
            intuitions as possible. And this is what we need for safe automatic inferencing in
            logic-based knowledge representation systems.
         </div>
         <div class="para e224">But what remains most mystifying about eliminativism (to everyone except eliminativists)
            is that it will not be satisfied by reducing statues to other things (e.g., "stuff-arranged-statuewise"),
            but insists that we affirm that there are no statues at all. Why can't it be the case
            that stuff-arranged-statuewise is a statue? Isn't that what we mean by "statue"? Can't
            we simply affirm that statues are nothing more than stuff-arranged-statuewise without
            going on to deny the existence of statues?
         </div>
         <div class="para e225">The eliminativist rejection of reductionist alternatives is uncompromising. The answer
            to "isn't stuff-arranged-statuewise a statue?" is: No, there are no statues; there
            is stuff-arranged-statuewise, but stuff-arranged-statuewise isn't a statue. Of course
            it is stuff-arranged-statuewise which is the result of sculpting, and stuff-arranged-statuewise
            which gives art historians statue experiences, but nevertheless: there are no statues.
            Statues, even reduced to stuff-arranged-statuewise, still create puzzles, and perhaps,
            in addition, are causally redundant, have inadequate identity conditions, and violate
            the principles of ontological parsimony... etc.  Reductionisms does not address any
            of these objections.
         </div>
         <div class="para e226">The eliminativist answer to "but isn't stuff-arranged-statuewise what we mean by 'statue'?"
            is: maybe, but probably not. Most people seem to mean a thing, a statue, by "statue"
            and not stuff-arranged-statuewise [
            <div class="xref e227" linkend="merricks01"></div>]. Though of course one 
            <div class="emphasis e228" role="ital">could</div> mean stuff-arranged-statuewise by "statue"; just as one could mean biscuits-with-gravy
            by "statue". There should be no argument about that -- the meaning of words is a matter
            of convention. One's own idiolect can attach any meaning whatsoever to any word. And
            if "there are statues" 
            <div class="emphasis e229" role="ital">is</div> understood to mean "there is stuff arranged statue-wise" then the eliminativist will
            grant that that sentence is true, and literally true -- but she will still not grant
            that a sentence understood this way implies that there are statues. This is because
            the eliminativist does not mean "stuff-arranged-statuewise" by statue when she says
            "there are no statues. By "statue" the eliminativist means statue, and by "there are
            no statues" the

                     <div class="para e232">Precisely how we are to understand ordinary beliefs and ordinary sentences about statues,
                        from either the eliminativist or reductivist perspectives, is much debated.  The sentence
                        "The TPS memo is now longer" is literally false according to both the document eliminativist
                        and the string-in-a-role reductivist. For the eliminativist it is false because there
                        is no TPS memo. For the reductivist it is false because the TPS memo cannot become
                        longer. But what shall we say that the ordinary folk belief expressed by that sentence
                        when it is uttered casually by an office worker? The reductivist may be comfortable
                        saying that the ordinary belief expressed by the sentence is true even though the
                        sentence is not literally true, just as "A dark fog of anxiety descended upon the
                        congregation" might be true, even though it is not literally true. [Where literal
                        truth would imply that 
                        <div class="emphasis e233" role="ital">there exists an object x such that x is an dark-fog-of-anxiety...etc.</div>] This is perhaps because the reductivist may believe that the string-in-a-role view
                        of documents is already implicit (even if hard to discern) in our commonsense beliefs.
                        Eliminativists however will be more likely to insist that the sentence in question
                        reveals that the office worker does have a false belief, namely that documents exist,
                        and then offer an account of how such false beliefs can be "almost as good as true"[
                        <div class="xref e234" linkend="merricks01"></div>].

         <div class="para e235">But these answers are frustrating if not inflammatory. To get a sense of how one might
            learn to live without documents, and like it, we begin by taking a closer look at
            the nature of predication.
         </div>
         <div class="para e236">When social circumstances put a string in the distinctive communicative role described
            in last year's paper, why shouldn't one go on to say, as we said last year, that the
            string is then a document, that this in fact is what we mean by "document", just being
            a string in a particular kind of role? This is the reductivist complaint to the eliminativist.
            The eliminativist will answer: because this would have counterintuitive results (documents
            that are not modifiable), puzzles (things that are modifiable and not modifiable),
            and violate parsimony (if we can get along without positing documents, shouldn't we?),
            etc. But such arguments are not decisive when faced with competing claims on the same
            grounds (what is counterintuitive and what isn't) unless we have a better understanding
            of what it means to affirm the existence of stuff-arranged-statuewise while resisting
            statues. Or, in our case here, affirm the existence of strings in roles, but deny
            the existence of documents.
         </div>
         <div class="para e237">One answer might go this way. It is often noted that there are many senses of the
            verb "to be". Identity (represented in symbolic logic as "x=y") is one; predication
            ("Fx") is another; constitution still another, and there are more. Our business here
            is with predication. Taking a closer look at predication we can see that it in turn
            might be divided into two sorts. There is exemplification ("Fido is brown"), and there
            is instantiation ("Fido is a mammal"). Both of these are represented with the same
            sort of formulas in symbolic logic (e.g., "Fx"), but arguably they are profoundly
            different in nature.

         <div class="para e242">Making peace with eliminativism might mean simply accepting that "is a document" is
            like "is brown", or "is a student", indicating that a particular thing exemplifies
            an attribute, rather than like "is a mammal", which indicates that a thing is an instance
            of a kind. From "Fido is a mammal" we can conclude that there are mammals, but from
            "Fido is brown" we do not conclude that there are "browns". Although we can, to be
            sure, conclude that there are brown things. Of course we can say that there is a document
            and simply mean by it that there is a thing which exemplifies a role, just like we
            could (but don't) say that there are "browns" and mean by it that there are things
            that are brown.
         </div>
         <div class="para e243">This line of reasoning may seem independent of the preceding argument that there are
            no documents because if there were documents they would be both modifiable and not
            modifiable.  But there is perhaps a connection.  The attraction of the social object
            approach to documents is that it is consistent with our commonsense view that a document
            is a mutable instance of a particular kind of thing, a view that supports, psychologically,
            the development of useful idioms for expressing and recording changes of interest.
            When we recognize that this perspective is ultimately inconsistent with other things
            we believe about documents we are perhaps in effect recognizing that document is not
            a kind with instances; but only a role that immutable strings play in contingent social
            circumstances.
         </div>
         <div class="para e244">It is hard to see how to weigh the competing considerations here. If one does proceed
            to affirm eliminativism on the grounds given then one can tidily resolve the entire
            document modifiability puzzle without positing counterintuitive unmodifiable documents.
            But at a cost, of course, of asserting a claim arguably every bit as counterintuitive:
            that there are no documents. The choice may seem imponderable, and it is not at all
            clear that restricting existence claims to instances of kinds tips the scale.

         <div class="title e246">Were we already there in 2009?</div>
         <div class="para e247">Last year we observed that the "string-in-a-role" theory of what documents are has
            as a consequence that on one account of the requirements for being a "type" (or kind)
            of thing in a formal ontology, documents are not types of things, but rather roles
            that types of things (strings) have. Guarino and Welty [
            <div class="xref e248" linkend="guarino00"></div>] argue that one requirement for a property being a type is that it is "rigid": the
            things that have that property have it necessarily. The property of being a person,
            for instance, is a type and meets the rigidity requirement -- a thing which is a person
            could not have been anything other than a person, and cannot lose the property of
            being a person. But the property of being a student is not a type, because the things
            (persons) that are students might not have been students and may, and typically do
            at some point, cease to be students. 
         </div>
         <div class="para e249">Last year we already had arrived at a sympathetic consideration of the view a document
            is not a type of thing, but a role that some types of things (e.g. strings) have in
            particular circumstances. How far is this from eliminativism? One sort of eliminativist,
            the sort which bases their eliminativism on the kind/attribute distinction just elaborated,
            might say not far at all. The non-rigid nature of the property of being a document
            itself indicates that in a sound ontology 
            <div class="emphasis e250" role="ital">document</div> is not a type/kind of thing but rather a way that things of a kind (strings) are
            related. The clash of string-in-role reductivism with our intuitive notion of modifiable
            documents reidentifiable over time might be taken to reveal that string-in-a-role
            reductivists have not fully internalized their own analysis, perhaps trying to use
            the hyphenated phrase "string-in-a-role" to have it both ways, inappropriately reifying
            a role.
         </div>
         <div class="para e251">But the string-in-role reductivist will counter that the distinction between kinds
            and attributes is dubious, and even if real it does not obviously support kind/attribute-based
            eliminativism with respect to documents. After all, we don't say that there are no
            students just because we recognize that the property of being a student is not rigid
            -- being a person enrolled in an educational institution simply is what we mean by
            "student".

                     <div class="para e253">There is a difference between two sorts of eliminativist positions that is relevant
                        here. Some eliminativists will allow that there is a thing (e.g., a lump of bronze)
                        which has a property ("being statuesque" Chisholm suggests, though probably not seriously),
                        even though there are no statues. Others do not admit the existence of a thing thing
                        that has such a property, and instead make plural reference to other things (things
                        that the non-eliminativist would say are constituents of the lump of bronze) asserting
                        that it is those things arranged-statuewise that provide us with statue experiences,
                        rather than any thing being statuesque. Document eliminativism, as presented here,
                        seems to be an eliminativism of the former sort.  This constrains what sort traditional
                        eliminativist arguments are likely to be supportive. The kind/attribute distinction
                        for instance seems relevant to document elimination but not statue elimination.  Causal
                        redundancy supports statue elimination but probably not document elimination.

            As to modifiability being integral to the concept of a document, the string-in-role
            reductivist can simply say we are often wrong about what is or is not an essential
            feature of a concept. We once thought that documents could be modified, we now know
            that they cannot be modified.
