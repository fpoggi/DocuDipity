               in
               which content is being submitted, as described above. We do not take articles in HTML.
               We also do a complete review of sample articles for each new journal to be sure that
               the content provider is able to provide content that is
               structurally and semantically correct.
            </div>

               process as well. This seems like an obvious one, but there was a surprising amount
               of controversy about this in the early days of PMC, and we still get invalid files.
               Problems
               usually arise now because the submitter has made a DTD change (as simple as adding
               a new
               character entity to the DTD) without telling us or sending an updated DTD.

               It was
               designed to be an "easy target to hit" when transforming content from the over 40
               different
               input models that we receive content in. Currently we are writing content into version

               all mappings of PUBLIC and SYSTEM IDs for any DTD that we use in the XML catalog on
               our
               Linux machines and then create other catalogs from it each time it is updated. We
               create an
               SGML Catalog for the SGML tools that we use; a single "Oxygen" catalog that
               everyone on the team can use over the network with the XML editor; and a copy of the

               http-based copies of the DTDs for PMC International sites. The XML Catalog is an essential

            group of Content Managers who marshall the content through the workflow and deal with
            the
            exceptions and communicate with the publishers. But, we have a group in the middle
            that writes
            and maintains the XSL transforms. 
         </div>
         <div class="para e142">It is not easy to find the right people for this group. Our document conversion writers
            need to have the strong attention to detail, unending curiosity, and a desire to always
            find a better way to do things of a good programmer. But, they also need to live in
            a world where mixed-content does not frightent them. Because we are writing transforms
            to maintain the meaning and intend of the origingal article, we slip out of the black-and-white
            prgrammer world into a world of grays. We need to represent the article that was submitted
            to the archive - and not necessarily the file that was submitted. 
         </div>
         <div class="para e143">A successful PMC document conversion writer lives with a foot in both camps: the world
            of the wants and desires of the content owners and the rule-driven world of people
            who build and run large systems. This is not something that is unique to PubMed Central
            by any means, but it does surprise some people that our group is made up of people
            who studied English, Art, and Library Sciences rather than Systems Design, COBOL or
            The DOM.
         </div>
         <div class="para e144">Because we work exclusively with documents and document XML, I have found that it
            is much
            easier to start with a (technically oriented) person with a publishing or printing
            background
            and teach them how to write a transform than to take a brilliant programmer and teach
            them how
            to think about documents.

         <div class="title e146">Some Challenges: When Print Goes Away</div>
         <div class="para e147">There are still a few things that give us problems in PMC. First, because of the rapid
            changes in article publishing since the invention of the Internet, journal publishing
            models
            have started to change. A business that had a pretty stable model of articles in issues
            that
            printed and mailed on a periodic schedule has been shifting to publishing on a continuous
            basis - with articles made available online as soon as they are ready and then collected
            into
            print issues after some time (or not collected and printed at all). 
         </div>
         <div class="para e148">Early PMC was created based on the issue model, and we have had to be flexible to
            handle these changes.
         </div>
         <div class="para e149">One thing that we have done to remain flexible here to allow us to deal with this
            continuous publication model is to be very strict about publication
            dates in articles. Depending on the publication model of a journal, an article may
            have one
            publication date (for traditional print-based journals) or an article-level publication
            date
            and a collection-level publication date (for articles that are published online and
            then
            collected into a print or online issue. volume, or collection. See the essay on
            &lt;pub-date&gt; in the Tagging Guidelines 
            <div class="citation e150" linkend="PMC06">[PMC06]</div>.
         </div>
         <div class="para e151">The rise of the internet has also brought about another "Continuous publication" idea,
            and that is continuous publication of the same document - or updates to an article.
            We have not seen too much of this in PMC yet, but we have been preparing ourselves.
            Each article in the PMC database is assigned an ArticleID and an ArticleInstanceID.
            Any new version of an article creates a new ArticleInstance, and all ArticleInstances
            for a given article have the same ArticleID. This allows us to store multiple versions
            of articles, retrieve the latest (by ArticleID), and to retrieve any version (by ArticleInstanceID).
            Fortunately, how the Journal Publishers will handle will need to be decided by the
            Journal Publishers.

         <div class="title e153">Conclusion</div>
         <div class="para e154">The success we have had at PMC has really been due to a combination of factors including
            our strictness to upholding the XML models that we use, our flexibility (to a point)
            that we have with our content providers, the tools that we've put together to make
            our jobs and the jobs of our content providers easier, and teh fine people we have
            working on the team. To be fair, it is also nice to have the resources of the National
            Center for Biotechnology Information and the National Library of Medicine behind us
            as well as the support of the NIH in general, who have declared that copies of all
            peer-reviewed articles that report on NIH-funded research must be deposited to PubMed
            Central and made available within 12 months of the publication date 
            <div class="citation e155" linkend="Beck02">[Beck02]</div>. I have to include that just to be fair.
