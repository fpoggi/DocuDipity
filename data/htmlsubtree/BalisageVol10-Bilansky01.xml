               The value of possible collections of slide sets from institutional and other contexts
               is discussed.  This paper proposes a model: the essential intellectual content of
               a slide set can be identified as an abstract version of the information that survives

         </div>
         <div class="para e27">Efforts to collect and curate important intellectual documents have focused on books
            and journals, reports, and other forms of communication inherited from the past. 
            Efforts to currate new media are not so common or so mature.  In our present moment,
            slide sets are one of the most common newer forms for presenting information.  Despite
            their ubiquity and frequent reproduction and circulation, there has been little effort
            to collect and curate slide sets.  In this paper, I propose a model for encoding slides
            that can be used to collect and curate them. I will explore why slide sets should
            be curated, what elements of slide sets should be encoded, and what guidelines for
            encoding them might look like.  
         </div>
         <div class="para e28">As I will propose, for purposes of curation, the essential intellectual content of
            a slide set can be identified as an abstract version of the information that survives
            translation of the slide set into PDF:  text, formulae, important graphics, but no
            animations, minimal if any description of style, and no distinction among the forty
            different ways slide software may progress from one slide to another.  TEI offers
            a suitable XML vocabulary for this purpose--even if this might be the first application
            of TEI to born-digital documents.  Others are also feasible, but the differences among
            them are less important than the difference between some representation of slide sets
            we can collect and curate and no such representation.
         </div>
         <div class="para e29">A note on terminology:  Collections of slides prepared, most often (although not always),
            to be displayed for audiences of presentations are most commonly called--after the
            most-used software to produce them--“PowerPoints,” but “slide decks” or “slide sets”
            might be more appropriate, since sets of slides can be produced in any number of ways:
            by PowerPoint, KeyNote, Prezi, TeX with Beamer, or hand-rolled XML or HTML, or acetate,
            et cetera.   I will use “slide set” throughout this talk, and my proposed model should
            work for slide sets regardless of the technology with which they are produced.
         </div>
         <div class="para e30">Why curate slide sets at all? PowerPoint belongs to a select group of software that
            is so
            disliked, one can buy tee shirts making fun of it.  Edward Tufte has famously argued
            that
            PowerPoint impedes communication and makes for ineffective, even irresponsible presentations.
            He concludes that slides should be replaced by handouts and PowerPoint is bad at producing
            those documents as well. From the curatorial point of view, however, the first question
            to ask
            is what functions slide sets serve; the answers can help us recognize the needs and
            potential
            value of curation.
         </div>
         <div class="para e31">Documents often serve functions and have significance beyond their original design.
            A driver’s license, for example, is more often produced in order to purchase alcohol
            and cold medicine, to cash checks, or to board an aircraft than as proof that the
            bearer is licensed to operate a motor vehicle.  Similarly, the primary purpose that
            a slide set is generally understood to serve is as a visual aid during a presentation.
            Just like a driver’s license, however, slides are pressed into service in all sorts
            of ways.
         </div>
         <div class="para e32">Slides can be surrogates for presentations where they had served as visual aids or
            they can be their own complete texts. Rather than only being tied to a specific presentation
            or event, slide sets may record details of which audience members will want a record
            in the future.  Speakers will often say, 
            <div class="quote e33">Don’t worry about copying down these references [or URLs, statistics, etc.], you’ll
               have them in the slides later,
            </div> and so on.  I have PowerPoints on my computer that I keep for reference long after
            I attended the talks:  they have statistics and phone numbers and URLs that I don’t
            record anywhere else in any other form.  Sets of slides often circulate as complete
            documents in their own right, as containers of information.  
         </div>
         <div class="para e34">Plato's Socrates was deeply troubled by the practice of creating a written record
            of a speech and circulating the text beyond the original setting.  But today we do
            it all the time.  By convention, slides have come to function, more or less explicitly,
            as records of face-to-face talks.  It’s common to seek out the slides from presentations
            we missed.  Thus they can be surrogates for the talks themselves.  
         </div>
         <div class="para e35">As a chance to provide the first draft of notes, they can be artifacts of the speaker's
            intention. They can also reflect what speakers consider important, as some points
            would be committed to writing on a slide and others wouldn’t.  (This practice, it’s
            worth noting, is so well established that some speakers flout it, and use slides to
            display text they will argue with, or that will otherwise comment on the main points
            they make.)  In this way, they are significant and worth attention even if a complete
            transcript or video or audio is available.  
         </div>
         <div class="para e36">Slides have particular significance in the context of higher education, as they strain
            under the load of educational content.  Campus disability programs mandate that printouts
            of slide sets be provided to some students before class.  This requirement depends
            on the assumptions that slides are used in most, if not every, meeting of every class
            and that much of the content to be learned can be found on the slides.  They have
            also become centerpieces of online education.  The instruction in MOOCs like the Khan
            Academy and Coursera consists mostly of desktop capture with audio, and these tend
            to center on slide decks.

         <div class="para e43">As a genre of document that many people in our current historical moment spend time
            creating and consuming, slide sets are worth attention.  However, when we imagine
            the potential value of large collections of slides, their value and the importance
            of curation becomes clearer.  
         </div>
         <div class="para e44">For example, in higher education, we can imagine collecting all the slide sets used
            in online courses by one university over the course of so many years, or all resident
            and online courses of one term, or all the slides used in iSchools or CIC schools,
            or all the slides used for courses in Coursera, or all the slides used by professors
            in the University of Chicago’s department of economics, or all the slides created
            by a given prominent scholar.  Other collections are also possible, such as all the
            slide decks used in mission briefings in a given U.S. Army brigade while in Afghanistan
            over a given span of time.
         </div>
         <div class="para e45">We can leverage large collections to ask interesting questions.  We could mine all
            citations and all hyperlinks.  Someone might want to see all slide sets from iSchool
            courses that have cited Noam Chomsky on, or all the individual slides in the collection
            where Chomsky is mentioned, or those that mention both Chomsky and Dublin Core.  
            How many have linked to a W3C Website?  How frequently do slide sets use media with
            Creative Commons licenses?  What kinds of maps are used in Army mission briefings?
            
         </div>
         <div class="para e46">The peculiarities of slides can express the conventions of audience expectations in
            specific disciplines, as well as the style of individuals--as is true of other textual
            forms.  Tardy finds that members of disciplines quickly learn how to conform their
            slide decks to their discipline and audiences.  Collections of slide sets would thus
            present important opportunities for those who study communication or information practices
            in various communities.
         </div>
         <div class="para e47">If the collection is large enough, we can ask linguistic and other structural questions.
            Text-mining could lead to linguistic discoveries, through techniques like topic-modeling.
            We could also make discoveries about the use of the form itself.  How often are previews
            and other metalinguistic techniques used overall?  What does a typical first slide
            look like?  How many slides would it take to make a slide set too long?
         </div>
         <div class="para e48">When we consider that slide sets are common currency in business, public life, and
            intellectual life, and the many kinds of information that collections of these sets
            could yield, the need to collect and curate slide sets should be more apparent.
         </div>
         <div class="para e49">Beyond an assertion like, “every slide set contains at least one slide,” it's hard
            to generalize about all slide sets.  There are a dizzying number of possibilities
            to account for.
         </div>
         <div class="para e50">Slides are produced by many different methods, each with vast feature sets producing
            their own versions of elements.  The mind boggles when we contemplate the many possible
            combinations of settings and options that are theoretically possible.  Stepping back
            from theory, we can reflect on the great diversity in actually existing slide sets
            in our experience.  There is a lot to account for:  slides, headings, text, text which
            might be formatted like a heading but is not serving semantically as a heading, numbers,
            formulae, citations, names of persons, names of places, hyperlinks, tables, graphics
            illustrative and decorative, images layered on images (e.g., circles and arrows),
            audio, animations, video, transitions, automated timed transitions and so on. 
         </div>
         <div class="para e51">What are slides, really?  To convey information, they function very much like comic
            books (or graphic novels).  Slides contain graphics such as diagrams or photographs,
            limited text—-which can be a word or two—-and sometimes text quoted from another,
            and graphics that comment on other graphics, such as circled words and arrows.  Sometimes
            the images convey a lot of content, and other times they are merely illumination (or,
            "clip art”).  I would suggest that at bottom slides work through three relationships:
            elements in spatial relationships with each other on a slide, slides with chronological
            relation to each other, and slide sets in relation to the speaker.    
         </div>
         <div class="para e52">The last of these relationships, I would argue, should be set aside for our purposes
            here.  On one hand, I would agree with Gross and Harmon and Knoblauch, among others,
            when they say that we can only understand slides as parts of a whole: individual elements
            on individual slides forming a slide deck and all aspects of speakers' delivery in
            interacting with them.  But on the other hand, this view ignores the many uses that
            slides are put to outside of presentations.
         </div>
         <div class="para e53">In deciding what counts as content to be encoded, one choice we can make is a choice
            made by many creators of slide sets.  Slide sets are often distributed as PDFs.  So,
            we can conclude that many rhetors and audiences (senders and receivers) are content
            with the amount of information that survives after conversion to PDF:  text and images.
            This does more than boil things down to a manageable scale.  This choice points to
            a discrete, coherent document to model.
         </div>
         <div class="para e54">What is to be encoded, then, are the spatial arrangement of elements on slides and
            the chronological arrangement of slides in a deck.  I consider these two sets of characteristics
            as essential because this is what is preserved when slides are circulated outside
            of a presentation, and because most of what is left out of this model are aspects
            of delivery and would be best captured in audiovisual media.
         </div>
         <div class="para e55">Although there are many more nuances to discuss about the rhetorical and semantic
            work of slides, the important point is that a functional model of slides would allow
            us to describe them independently of the software used to create them. 
         </div>
         <div class="para e56">A number of vocabularies could be used to encode slides.  Presentation slides are
            often authored in XML in a number of vocabularies.  There is already a customization
            of DocBook that provides for the authoring of new slides (
            <div xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" class="link e57" xlink:actuate="onRequest" xlink:show="new" xlink:type="simple">http://www.docbook.org/schemas/5x-custom.html#slides</div>).  Use of DITA (

         </div>
         <div class="para e59">I suggest that it would be best to encode slides in TEI, which offers a finely developed
            vocabulary to account for the structural and semantic content of documents that would
            be of most use to curators, archivists, and other scholars.
         </div>
         <div class="para e60">For the sake of elegance and parsimony, and also for ease of adoption by encoders
            and collectors, I believe the best model would be one that leaves TEI’s DTD unmodified,
            that is, without creating any new elements or significantly modifying any existing
            ones.  Thus semantic customization could be laid on top of the structure of the TEI
            P5 documents.
         </div>
         <div class="para e61">Because slide sets present only one required element (at least one slide) beyond what
            TEI always requires, the rest of this model is going to look like suggestions, with
            a 
            surprisingly short list of TEI elements needed to represent slide sets. 
         </div>
         <div class="para e62">So, from the top to the bottom, or outside-in:  </div>
         <div class="para e63">TEI’s root element, 
            <div class="code e64"> &lt;text&gt; </div>, will serve to contain a sequence of slides.     
         </div>
         <div class="para e65">Two elements in the standard TEI header will be particularly important.  First, the
            
            <div class="code e66">&lt;publicationStmt&gt;</div> contains a 
            <div class="code e67">&lt;settingDesc&gt;</div>.  This can describe the setting, or the occasion, or the rhetorical situation:
         </div>
         <div class="programlisting e68" xml:space="preserve">&lt;publicationStmt&gt;
            	&lt;profileDesc&gt;

            event? &lt;/settingDesc&gt;
            &lt;/profileDesc&gt;
            &lt;/publicationDesc&gt;
         </div>
         <div class="para e69">The encoding at first might seem simple, but on further consideration might appear
            truly distressing.  If I use the set of slides corresponding to this paper to present
            my model to my seminar on document modeling, and then I close this file I’m working
            from and don’t open it again until I present to Balisage, or email it to someone who
            missed my talk, are these the same document?  I am tempted to say no, two events,
            two documents.  I must leave the implications for accounting for documents to be discussed
            at another time.
         </div>
         <div class="para e70">Since the most meaningful encoding will be not single sets but collections, we should
            include collection or series of information in the TEI header:

         <div class="para e72">What is included here will depend on the goals of the collection and how the collectors
            keep track of slide sets. 
         </div>
         <div class="para e73">Slides themselves can be encoded as 
            <div class="code e74">&lt;div&gt;</div>s:

         <div class="para e78">Position is important, and TEI provides a mechanism for locating elements in the original
            text.  For our purposes X and Y coordinates in relative units like ems would do the
            job.  
         </div>
         <div class="para e79">TEI provides a means of accounting for common features of slides, such as citations,
            both full and partial (

         </div>
         <div class="para e85">Resolving and recording URLs is very important.  Often tiny URLs are used in slide
            sets, to make it easy for listeners to take them down.  The trouble is that these
            URLs take users to a third-party database (which may not be in business six months
            from now, or even if it survives may not retain all those user-created URLs), which
            in turn redirects to the full URL.  In encoding slides we should capture the destination,
            so as to record that “http:tin.y/blAh7” takes people to the Smithsonian Institution’s
            historic flashlight exhibit.

            <div class="code e96">&lt;gap&gt;</div>.  TEI, of course, also allows us to mark tags we add, such as parts of speech, with

            (ideally in a form that is accessible to all users and will be for as long as the

            that.

         <div class="para e103">As we consider other aspects of slide sets--for example, the automatic, timed transitions
            of pecha kucha presentations (with only images on slides and regimented time on each
            slide before it automatically advances)--these elements of the presentation interpenetrate
            delivery, and anything short of a complete transcript, or audio and video recording
            of the talk, will fail to capture every aspect of the presentation.  I’ve suggested
            that slides make meaning not only through elements in spatial relationships on slides
            and slides' chronological relation to each other, but also through the interaction
            of speaker to slides.  I am merely suggesting here a model for preserving the first
            two relations.

         <div class="para e104">Are we interested in encoding slide-sets or presentations?  Although my case below

         <div class="para e107">The case for including the version history of slides is more compelling, but it would
            set us on an even more difficult path.  This view would start by observing that the
            slides we see have a long and often significant version history.  They are revised,
            corrected, distributed, revised after they’re distributed, revised during presentations,
            copied, borrowed, repurposed, stolen, corrected, reshuffled, added, subtracted, modified,
            and forked.

         <div class="para e108">Consider a scenario that represents a common kind of circulation of slides:  graduate
            student X is teaching for professor Y, and she uses a slide originally from professor
            Z.  Afterwards, professor Y adds the slide to his lectures.  This can be quite significant
            to anyone following the flow of ideas and the research of those involved.  If this
            still seems like trivia, suppose for example, that X and Y go on to win the Nobel

         <div class="para e115">Let’s imagine that when this slide in Figure 2 was produced, the creator had little
            experience with PowerPoint, and used a built-in template to add text and image to
            a slide.  Design elements adopted here unconsciously end up carrying meaning to an
            audience.  The text above the image, for example, was styled as a header for the entire
            slide, and this was not the intention.  This points to a broader set of issues when
            it comes to encoding and real-world documents being created right now in our digital
            age.  Semantic choices are often obscured by users relying on procedural markup, and
            vice versa.  Most users of Microsoft word use formatting such as bold type and larger
            font-size to indicate headings, even though they have the option of using tags like
            
            <div class="code e116">&lt;H1&gt; and &lt;H2&gt;</div>.  On the other hand, many slides produced in PowerPoint and other programs are done
            using templates, where semantics elements are supplied.  In one case, procedural markup
            indicates genuine semantic choices, where in the other semantic markup is used largely

            in principle it is less than ideal to cut off such an argument before it happens by
            not capturing the changes.
         </div>
         <div class="para e124">Capturing all the changes could be very valuable.  It would also probably be a practical
            impossibility.  To begin with, noting all the changes on a single slide and encoding
            them in a way that can be handled by machines and useful to humans would be difficult.
            TEI provides for storing multiple versions at the phrase level, with  
            <div class="code e125">&lt;rdg&gt; and &lt;lem&gt;</div>.  As these small changes mount, the temptation grows to encode multiple versions
            of a slide complete, as changes fork in multiple directions.  And this would require
            significantly more work of encoding, and also creating a distinct schema, no matter
            which vocabulary we start with. 
         </div>
         <div class="para e126">Faced with two versions of one slide, it might be easier to encode and include both
            versions.   This might require a modification of TEI's basic document model, to alter
            the behavior of the 
            <div class="code e127">&lt;app&gt;</div> element, along with 
            <div class="code e128">&lt;lem&gt;</div> and 
            <div class="code e129">&lt;rdg&gt;</div>, which as I read the guidelines can only contain phrase-level elements and cannot
            contain 
            <div class="code e130">&lt;div&gt; or &lt;p&gt; or &lt;ab&gt;</div>. There is no reason why a 
            <div class="code e131">&lt;rdg&gt;</div> could not contain the same elements as were in the

         <div class="para e133">But I would suggest that a commitment to capture the addition, deletion, and reordering
            lies on a path to ruin.  We have by this point left TEI behind, and I would find it
            difficult even to compose a workable model in the abstract that could encode all the
            revision history of slide decks that could be handled mechanically and understood
            by humans, even if we would all agree on their value.
         </div>
         <div class="para e134">Accounting for revision history of slides would be a valuable effort, but also a much
            more ambitious one, and it would require a significant modification of TEI, perhaps
            importing more from a vocabulary like DITA.  If we were sufficiently ambitious, DITA
            might  allow for a model that allows individual slides to float free as 
            <div class="code e135">&lt;topic&gt;</div>s, gathered into this or that 
            <div class="code e136">&lt;map&gt;</div>, representing a deck of slides for a given presentation.

         <div class="para e137">DITA, however, does not provide the vocabulary for marking all the historical elements
            of the text.  We would either be importing a number of TEI elements into a modified
            DITA, or the reverse, and both choices are frightening.  I must respond to this alternative
            view on pragmatic grounds.

         <div class="para e138">The hierarchy inherent in our model encourages parsimony.  If I use the slides from
            another professor's lecture in a lecture of my own, with limited alteration, the slides
            are all mine, delivered in my class. 
            <div class="code e139">&lt;SettingDesc&gt;</div> resides in the header and is inherited by the slides contained in the document. 
            The provenance of individual slides is a matter for a footnote.

            and the previous .ppt format) into XML in useable syntax, and vice versa.   I would
            like to see large collections of slides.  I am working towards a model that would
            be taken up easily and quickly by presenters and encoders.

         <div class="para e142">My goal in this presentation is also simple enough: I want to start a conversation
            about the curation of slide sets.  In our present moment, vast collections of slides
            are created that could be meaningful in understanding the moment we live in, to both
            our present and future selves.
