            <div class="para e10">XML, LaTeX, and other structured-document systems are used
               	daily by those experienced in computing, and by technical
               	authors in many fields. Outside these areas, however, there is
               	a widespread lack of adoption, or resistance to these systems.
               	This forms a barrier to the creation and use of reliable,
               	persistent, unencumbered, and reusable documents, which in
               	turn adds a hidden burden to the use of corporate,
               	institutional, and personal information.
            </div>
            <div class="para e11">This paper reports on a study of the usability of editing
               	software for structured documents. It extends the research
               	outlined in earlier work [
               <div class="xref e12" linkend="fly06"></div>], where it
               	was found that there was no essential difference in markup
               	operations between any of the editing software tested, and
               	that any distinction was possibly more attributable to the
               	interaction design of the interfaces.
            </div>
            <div class="para e13">The objective is to see if changes to the interface to
               	make it user-centered rather than technology-centered could
               	result in greater acceptability to authors and editors both
               	inside and outside the IT and markup fields, and thereby lead
               	to an improved adoption rate of structure-guided writing and
               	editing software.
            </div>
            <div class="para e14">The earlier analyses of software and features sought by
               	users were extended to cover more recent data, and a survey of
               	existing users was conducted to determine how the interfaces
               	were being used. The results are being applied to construct a
               	model of the interface which can be tested for usability
               	compared with existing systems.

         <div class="para e44">Writers and editors have until recently used a wide range of
            editing software. In the Humanities, document-based
            collaboration is relatively uncommon [
            <div class="xref e45" linkend="lar06"></div>],
            so authors were less constrained by compatibility issues;
            whereas within the IT and scientific communities, the range has
            been smaller, partly because of the need to use specialist
            notations, and partly because of the need to remain compatible
            with co-authors [
            <div class="xref e46" linkend="ang04"></div>].  In the wider world
            of writing outside research and academic institutions the
            difference was wider, because writers do not typically form
            homogeneous categories. Not all such software was necessarily
            ideal for the purpose, and much of it has fallen by the wayside
            in the path of technological advance; particularly in the face
            of the predominance of a single operating system and a single
            wordprocessor.

         <div class="para e47">The onus of interpretation, customization, and rendering of
            publishable material has customarily been the responsibility of
            the publisher or other intermediary, who expends large sums on
            specialist labor for this purpose. However, in some fields,
            publishers have been asking authors for camera-ready copy for
            over 20 years to minimize costs, and the effort involved and the quality
            of these submitted documents has been a cause for complaint on
            both sides [

            libraries, search-engine optimizers, and printers have similar
            concerns: the quality of the documents (in source or
            camera-ready form) is often insufficient for meaningful capture,
            re-use, or formatting [
            <div class="xref e49" linkend="wil95"></div>]. The causes are
            many, and have been well-established for many years, but among
            them is a lack of suitable software and lack of author education

         <div class="para e72">The survey of users was constructed to find out what
            software the authors and editors used and how they used it. The
            survey was piloted for a week in April 2006 and the revised
            version made available online between February and April 2008.
            It used the phpESP web survey package, and was publicized via
            the online forums to which it was addressed (the comp.text.tex,
            comp.text.xml, and comp.text.sgml Usenet newsgroups, and the

            might have seen the announcements of the survey) is difficult to
            make: the membership of the mailing lists was approximately 700;
            but the readership of the Usenet newsgroups is not knowable, and
            may extend to many thousands. The responses therefore represent
            a small interested sample, and there will have been many readers
            whose interests in XML were in its use for data representation,
            not structured documents.

            but concentrates on identifying how users of structured editing

               	components adduced where needed (principally figures, tables,

               	But the existence of the tree, and its supervention in the

            embedding, context-awareness, and many other related
            technologies, has led to the frequent blurring of the
            distinction between applications for the user. Sending an email
            can now invoke the default wordprocessor as the editor; clicking
            on a hypertext link in a document will open a web browser;
            following a link in a browser will open the (usually)
            appropriate application for the type of file; and a table in a
            document could be provided by an embedded spreadsheet object.

         <div class="para e245">The commonality of the interface framework (the position of
            the menus, arrangement of the toolbar, and availability of the

            easier for the user to carry across skills from one application
            to another; but it also leads users into a state of unawareness
            of exactly which application is active at any one time. This
            also provides one of the building-blocks for the development of
            interface components which are generically grouped under the
            banner of 
            <div class="quote e246">Web 2.0</div>, which attempts to imbue all

            applications, even across platforms, share an increasingly
            common interface framework, and are increasingly expected by the
            users to provide the same affordances. User tolerance for
            differences based on platform, vendor, or application appears to
            be shrinking, such that a new product would have to offer some
            very radically new and valuable feature indeed for it to justify
            breaking the conceptual mold expected by the user.

            technologies employed underneath. The structure-directed
            document editing model, which requires a foreknowledge or

            specially or even avoided because of their meaning or ambiguity
            (in the opinion of the expert practitioners); or that they were
            opaque to the user because of terminology, placement,
            expectation, or effect (in the opinion of the users).

            typographic interface with no markup visible to the user.
            Whether or not an editor allows another form of access to the
            markup (tokenized, raw text, breadcrumb, or marching display),
            is not relevant for the present purpose: this is something the

            preferences to be set where there might be ambiguity, were
            considered to be outside the scope of this model. While these
            have been implemented in some systems, the present author is
            unaware of any specifically related to structural editing, and
            this would be an important area for future work.

            are essentially comparable in function, an interface's
            appearance as well as its apparent usability are regarded as
            actually

         <div class="para e259">By contrast, when functions are widely disparate, and the

            provide a third effect on the perceived usability.

                  	  targets, or acceptance of a scroll to the target and a click
                  	  on it). An attempt to add a reference to a non-existent
