            <div class="para e8">The semantics of XML markup is a perennial topic of discussion among markup enthusiasts,
               but these discussions often focus at the level of the meaning of a tag within a document,
               or within a document collection. Such discussions also have an inherent assumption
               of looking at the meaning of a tag at the moment. Employment of XML markup and machine
               ontologies for long-term digital preservation raises question of how meaning of tags
               may alter over time and how tags meaning may differ depending on the agent interpreting
               the tag. This paper discusses the Preserving Virtual Worlds project on the preservation
               of computer games and the semantic issues that arose in trying to use XML and OWL
               ontologies for long-term digital preservation.

         <div class="para e27">The issue of semantics has been of perenniel interest to those who study markup languages.
            From Eliot Kimber's presentation on HyTime semantic groves 
            <div class="xref e28" linkend="kimber1"></div> to Steven Newcomb's work on semantic integration 
            <div class="xref e29" linkend="newcomb1"></div> through more recent work such as Dubin's and Birnbaum's 
            <div class="xref e30" linkend="dubin1"></div> comparison of markup technologies for knowledge representation and Karen Wickett's
            
            <div class="xref e31" linkend="wickett1"></div> discussion of contextual aspects of semantic interoperability of markup langauges,
            discussions of what exactly tagging structures and markup 
            <div class="emphasis e32" role="ital">mean</div> and the implications of semantics for dealing with issues of interoperability and
            knowledge representation have consumed the time and energy of markup enthusiasts for
            decades.  In some sense, the entire literature on markup languages can be viewed as
            a continuing conversation about semantics and the best means for their technical and
            syntactical implementation in the realm of text.
         </div>
         <div class="para e33">For the past six years, participants in the 
            <div xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" class="link e34" xlink:actuate="onRequest" xlink:href="http://pvw.illinois.edu/pvw2/" xlink:show="new" xlink:type="simple">Preserving Virtual Worlds</div> projects have been investigating the preservation of computer games and interactive
            fiction.  A great deal of that work has focused on how to best employ XML and semantic
            technologies in the packaging of content and metadata for preservation.  XML metadata
            standards such as METS 
            <div class="xref e35" linkend="mcdonough1"></div>, PREMIS 
            <div class="xref e36" linkend="premis1"></div> and Dublin Core 
            <div class="xref e37" linkend="weibel1"></div>, along with new ontologies created in OWL-DL, have been employed in conjunction with
            data models such as FRBR 
            <div class="xref e38" linkend="ifla1"></div> and the Open Archival Information System (OAIS) Reference Model 
            <div class="xref e39" linkend="ccsds1"></div> to try to develop packaging mechanisms for long-term preservation of game software
            as well as knowledge bases regarding file formats necessary for digital preservation
            within the OAIS model.  Our team has benefited from earlier work on XML semantics,
            but as we endeavored to create XML mechanisms suitable for long-term preservation,
            there has seemed to us to be a component missing in much of the discussions of semantics
            and markup.
         </div>
         <div class="para e40">Ultimately, much of the discussion of XML semantics has focused on the question of
            
            <div class="quote e41">How is the meaning of a document augmented or otherwise affected by the presence of
               markup?
            </div>
            <div class="xref e42" linkend="marcoux1"></div> This is a valid and important question, but in focusing at the document level, I
            am afraid we may be focusing on the trees (and the groves) to the neglect of the larger
            forest. By employing a mental model of markup semantics which focuses on meaning as
            emerging from the interaction between a text, its markup and a reader, we may be missing
            other influences on meaning that operate at a larger scale than a single document,
            or even a collection.  In many situations, such influences may be irrelevant and safely
            ignored, but within the realm of digital preservation and, I suspect, many other enterprises
            worried about large scale knowledge representation, focusing on meaning at the document
            level may be problematic.  In the remainder of this paper, I will describe some of
            the problems we encountered in attempting to preserve computer games, XML's and OWL's
            role in our solutions to those problems, and discuss a possible alternate formulation
            of markup semantics based on social constructionist theory.

         <div class="para e45">The Preserving Virtual World project 
            <div class="xref e46" linkend="mcdonough2"></div> was an investigation into the preservation of computer and video games and interactive

            The information model depicted here sets out what OAIS calls the Archival Information
            Package, the body of information which an archive needs to preserve to insure the
            longevity of the data object, which is the original target of preservation. As shown,
            an archival information package for a preserved digital object should contain not
            only the object itself, but a variety of additional information, of which one of the
            most important types is 
            <div class="emphasis e54" role="ital">Representation Information</div>, the information that allows
            someone to take the sequences of bits which comprise the data object and
            interpret them as meaningful information. Representation information can be either
            structural or semantic in nature. Structure information maps bit sequences into basic
            data types (e.g., character data, integers, floats); the Unicode standard 
            <div class="xref e55" linkend="unicode1"></div>, for example, allows one to map a series of zeros and ones into
            a particular character set, while IEEE Standard 754-1985 
            <div class="xref e56" linkend="ieee1"></div>
            defines a mapping from bit sequences into floating point numbers. Semantic information,
            on the other hand, provides someone who is using the data with additional information
            they need to fully interpret it. Knowing that a particular string of 32 bits represents
            two short integers requires structure information; knowing that those integers represent
            the X and Y map coordinates of an object in a DOOM game map requires semantic
            information.
         </div>
         <div class="para e57">As can also be seen in 
            <div class="xref e58" linkend="figure1"></div>, representation information can be recursive in nature.  If structure or semantic
            representation information is itself in digital form, the archive should additionally
            store the representation information needed to decode the other representation information.
            Ultimately, this recursive chain can only be broken by storing representation information
            in a form that does not require the technological assistance of computer to display

         <div class="para e59">Conformance with this information model means that a digital archive will store not
            only the original data object, but also the associated standards and documentation
            defining the data format in which the object is written.  Within the realm of space
            science data preservation for which the OAIS Reference Model was originally intended,
            this is a relatively straightforward and unproblematic endeavor. Standards for codebook
            documentation of scientific data sets such as the Data Documentation Initiative Codebook
            
            <div class="xref e60" linkend="ddi1"></div> and the Data Format Definition Language (DFDL) 
            <div class="xref e61" linkend="Powell1"></div> provide relatively concise definitions of data formats used for scientific data.
            While they have some degree on reliance on additional standards for the definition
            of fundamental data types (e.g., DFDL assumes the use of W3C XML Schema data type
            definitions), the complete set of representation information required for data such
            as a social science survey is small and fairly well-bounded.
         </div>
         <div class="para e62">This proved not to be the case for the vast majority of the computer games that the
            Preserving Virtual Worlds project examined.  There were a number of problems involved
            in identifying and collecting a set of representation information documenting the
            data formats used in a particular game, but one stood out as being particularly problematic.
            Unlike scientific data, which is often quite intentionally recorded in a manner to
            facilitate its exchange and use across a variety of computing platforms using standards
            such as NetCDF or HDF5, executable software is tightly bound to a particular platform.
            The representation information set for a computer game thus often becomes equivalent
            to the information necessary to completely document its operating platform.
         </div>
         <div class="para e63">Consider a game like Blizzard Entertainment's 
            <div class="emphasis e64" role="ital">Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos</div> for OS X, and let us ignore the large number of different files and file formats
            employed by the game and focus solely on its main executable. This is a file in the
            Mach-O format. Structure information needed to interpret the Mach-O format begins
            with the

            a complete specification of the format in that it makes specific reference to another

            A section of text such as this:

            a good deal less so if you lack that experience. It is easy enough to include documentation
            on the C programming language in the representation information set for the Mach-O
            format but understanding that it is actually a C language data structure (and hence
            that the representation information set should include documentation on C) requires
            a relatively deep knowledge of computer software design and implementation.

         <div class="para e73">This problem is exacerbated when we move beyond considering structure information
            to considering the semantic information necessary to interpret a Mach-O binary executable.

            of Warcraft III on my desktop, the executing platform is based on the Intel 64 architecture.

            it references a large number of additional standards documents from ISO, IEEE, the
            World Wide Web Consortium and others. Understanding the specification also requires
            knowledge of the mathematics of Bézier curves, color theory, audio encoding techniques,
            and principles of font design. For any number of file formats employed by computer
            games, representation information sets are both large and poorly defined.

            was focused on preserving games within the context of academic research libraries,
            where detailed technical knowledge cannot be assumed for all users, and where even
            those users who possess advanced techical knowledge of 
            <div class="emphasis e83" role="ital">existing</div> platforms may have little knowledge of or experience with previous platforms.  I
            would expect any computer scientist today to have a reasonable working knowledge of
            modern disk operating systems and disk formatting operations, but the exact form of
            an Apple II disk image file or the instruction set for the Apple II's MOS 6502 microprocessor
            is something for which I would expect many would need to consult a manual.
         </div>
         <div class="para e84">This has meant that for computer games, identifying and collecting representation
            information is not simply an issue of documenting a particular file format. It is
            an exercise in knowledge representation and management.  If highly complex, multimedia
            objects such as game software are going to survive in the long-term, archivists will
            need to collect, organize and preserve a large body of additional information necessary
            to interpret those objects.  Or perhaps more precisely, they need to collect, organize
            and preserve the information necessary to allow an individual to acquire the knowledge
            to interpret those objects.  The problem the game preservationist confronts is that
            they do not need to merely preserve the game; they need to preserve people's ability
            to be able to understand the game, from the level of individual 0's and 1's on up.
         </div>
         <div class="para e85">This problem has dimensions other than the purely technical one we have been discussing.
            On the technical side, if we are to preserve the seminal interactive fiction game
            
            <div class="emphasis e86" role="ital">Adventure</div> in its original form, we need to preserve the ability to understand DEC's version
            of Fortran IV from the mid-1970s. If we wish to preserve people's ability to understand
            the importance of 
            <div class="emphasis e87" role="ital">Adventure</div> in computing history, however, there is other information that we might wish to preserve,
            documentation such as Dennis Jerz's historical examination of the game's development
            
            <div class="xref e88" linkend="jerz1"></div>. The OAIS reference model recognizes that all data objects have this form of contextualizing
            information, and recommends that an archival information package include information
            on "why the Content Information was created and hot it relates to other Content Information
            Objects."
            <div class="xref e89" linkend="ccsds1"></div> For scientific data collections, this will typically involve documentation on the
            reasons why a study was conducted, links to associated data sets, and in some cases
            links to publications based on the scientific data in question (metadata standards
            such as the previously mentioned Data Documentation Initiative provide XML facilities
            for recording these links). Attempting to apply the OAIS reference model outside the
            realm of scientific data quickly led our research team to the conclusion that digital
            preservation of computer games was more complicated. A cultural artifact such as a
            game has links to a much wider range of related materials. Documentation for the MIT
            game 
            <div class="emphasis e90" role="ital">SpaceWar!</div>, for example, would not really be complete without including reference to it being
            a tribute to E.E. "Doc" Smith's 
            <div class="emphasis e91" role="ital">Lensmen</div> novels as well as its information on its impact on later vector graphic games such

         </div>
         <div class="para e94">Ultimately, digital preservation is devoted to insuring users' ability to interpret
            the preserved material in both a specific technical and more general historical sense.
            Essentially, the goal of a preservationist is to allow users of libraries and archives
            to make sense of the information in a collection, whether their interests are technological,
            historical or cultural. In the next section, I will discuss the role that XML and
            OWL played in trying to pursue these goals, and then discuss the implications of this

            and contextual information about a game as part of a package used to preserve a game

            of information about the relationships between the digital files we would include
            in an archival package for a game, the Preserving Virtual Worlds team turned to XML
            and OWL as mechanisms to tackle this problem in knowledge representation and management.
            OWL-DL was used to create an ontology in which the major entities from the FRBR entity-relationship
            model were defined as OWL classes, and relationships from FRBR were defined as properties.
            Relationships between various information entities in the OAIS reference model were
            further defined as properties in the ontology relating different FRBR classes. A partial
            representation of the OWL class and property relationships in the Preserving Virtual
            Worlds ontology is shown in

            time.  An OAI-ORE file, for example, could provide URLs for the files comprising a
            game along with all of the files containing representation information and contextual
            information.  The OAI-ORE file could also be used to indicate that files represented
            instances of FRBR classes (e.g., file 'advf4.77-03-31' is a FRBR Item) and that different
            entities participated in relationships defined within the OAIS Reference Model (e.g.,
            file 'advf4.77-03-31' (a Fortran IV source code file) has representation information
            in the form of the FRBR Expression of DEC's Programmer's Reference Manual for Fortran
            IV, which in turn has a physical manifestation and an item exemplifying that manifestation

            technologies (see, for example,

            formed the backbone of a digital preservation effort for game software.  But examining
            our work more closely in retrospect, certain aspects of our ontology and its application
            strike me as troubling.
         </div>
         <div class="para e108">The first problem we encountered was that the OAIS relationships between information
            objects that appeared relatively clear semantically as described in the Reference
            Model turned out be somewhat more polysemous in actual application. If we examine
            the full network of representation information necessary to interpret a file in Adobe
            PDF format, for example, we find a great deal of subtle variation in the roles performed
            by representation information necessary to interpret the Adobe PDF specification itself.
            IEEE-754 obviously constitutes representation information for the Adobe PDF specification,
            and of a type clearly defined within the OAIS Reference Model: structure information.
            IEEE-754 defines the underlying bit patterns used to represent floating point numbers
            in Adobe PDF. A specification like CIE L*a*b* 
            <div class="xref e109" linkend="iso1"></div> also constitutes representation information necessary for a complete interpretation
            of PDF, as L*a*b* is one of the standard color spaces referenced within the PDF specification
            and the specification is necessary for understanding the semantics of color information
            embedded within some PDF documents. But other documents referenced within the Adobe
            PDF specification, while of assistance in interpreting information in a PDF file,
            are not representation in the same way that IEEE-754 or CIE L*a*b* are, which is to
            say, the Adobe PDF specification does not have a technical dependency on those 
            <div class="emphasis e110" role="under">specific</div> documents. 
            <div class="emphasis e111" role="ital">Graphics Gems II</div> 
            <div class="xref e112" linkend="arvo1"></div> and 
            <div class="emphasis e113" role="ital">Graphics Gems III</div> 
            <div class="xref e114" linkend="kirk1"></div> are both valuable texts for achieving an understanding of the Bézier curves used
            within the PDF specification, but no more so than a variety of other texts on that
            topic. They do provide semantic information that allows someone to make sense of a
            PDF document, and hence qualify as representation information, but their relationship
            to the PDF specification is not the same as the standards documents identified as
            normative by Adobe. The 
            <div class="emphasis e115" role="ital">Graphics Gems</div> series books could be replaced by substitutes and still leave the PDF specification
            interpretable in a way that is not true if IEEE-754 vanished from the Earth and all
            knowledge of it was lost. All of these texts, however, are at least referenced by
            the PDF specification itself.  Their status as representation information is therefore
            at least subtly different than, say,
            <div class="emphasis e116" role="ital">Visual Color and Color Mixture</div> 
            <div class="xref e117" linkend="cohen1"></div>, which while it provides the semantic information necessary to understand the matrix
            algebra operations for color space transformation employed within the PDF specification,
            is not referenced by that document at all. All of these ancillary texts might be considered
            representation information for the PDF specification; but their status as such is
            varied, and the application of a common ontological predicate (http://people.lis.uiuc.edu/~jmcdonou/PVW2.owl#hasRepresentationInformation)
            to link them all to the PDF specfication hides a great deal of semantic nuance.
         </div>
         <div class="para e118">Also somewhat disturbing in our examination of the XML preservation packages we were
            developing was the realization of the situationally-determined nature of the truth
            of assertions regarding representation information and context information. Consider
            a PDF instruction manual that comes with a game; while the PDF specification allows
            for embedding of JPEG image data within a PDF file, this particular file does not
            use JPEG data for its images.  If we ask, 'does this particular file have the ISO/IEC
            10918-1:1994 
            <div class="xref e119" linkend="iso2"></div> standard which defines the JPEG data format as part of its representation information
            network,' the answer is clearly 'no.' You do not need ISO/IEC 10918-1:1994 to decode
            the manual.  However, if we ask instead, does the representation information network
            for the PDF specification include ISO/IEC 10918-1:1994,' the answer is 'yes.' ISO/IEC
            10918-1:1994 is cited as a normative reference by the PDF specification, "indispensable"
            for the application of the PDF specification itself.
         </div>
         <div class="para e120">The OAIS Reference Model discussion of representation information seems to imply that
            representation information networks are specific to a data file, so for PDF files
            as a class, there can be no 
            <div class="emphasis e121" role="ital">a priori</div> determination of the representation network necessary for decoding a file. Identification
            of a representation information network has to be conducted on a file-by-file basis,
            significantly increasing the knowledge management burden on digital preservationists.
            Given that tools for automating the identification of representation networks for
            a file at this level of detail are non-existent, this is an unhappy realization for
            a digital preservationist. Equally unhappy, however, was the realization that the
            semantic interpretation we had been applying to our "hasRepresentationInformation"
            term was somewhat at odds with how the OAIS Reference Model describes representation
            information as a concept.  Our understanding aligned with asking the question of "in
            the abstract, does Document A have Document B as representation information" and not
            "in the case of this specific file, does Document A require Document B as representation
            information." This is clearly problematic at a variety of levels, not the least of
            which is 'how is a user in 100 years, seeing our ontology applied in a preservation
            environment, going to know that our interpretation of representation information is
            at variance with the original standards document which proposed the concept?'
         </div>
         <div class="para e122">One final problematic arose in applying our ontology in packaging of computer games,
            with respect to the idea of context information in the OAIS Reference Model. The OAIS
            Reference Model defines context information as "the information that documents the
            relationships of the Content Information to its environment. This includes why the
            Content Information was created and how it relates to other Content Information objects."
            The problem with this definition with respect to games is that the task of documenting
            a game's relationship to its environment and identifying how it relates to any and
            all other content information objects is a nigh-infinite task.  If I take a game like
            the original DOOM, do I need to document it's relationship to predecessor and successor
            games that employed similar themes (e.g., MindScape's The Colony and Valve's Half-Life),
            to alternative media presentations of the story  (
            <div class="xref e123" linkend="abhugh1"></div> and 
            <div class="xref e124" linkend="bartkowiak1"></div>), to other games from its manufacturer, id Software, to legal documents in a lawsuit
            filed by relatives of the survivors of the Columbine shootings against id Software?
            To archives of speedrun competitions using the game? To fan websites? To the approximately
            4,000 journal articles retrieved from Google Scholar in response to a search for "doom
            'computer game'"?  Completely specifying context is an impossible task, and for any
            given user, much of that context will be irrelevant.
         </div>
         <div class="para e125">This leads to a problem similar to the representation information problem. A given
            user will consider some documents as valuable context information and others as irrelevant,
            but those judgements will vary from user to user. Given this, any record I make as
            preservationist of context information is going to have an implied semantic connotation
            beyond simply 'this is context information' of 'this is what we believe is the important
            context information.'  And implicit in that relative value judgment will be a number
            of assumptions about what sort of scholarly activity is important (and what is necessary
            to support that scholarly activity). Scholars will interpret the application of a
            'hasContextInformation' predicate to information they need for their work as an endorsement
            of the significance of their field of study; similarly, finding that information they
            need doesn't receive recognition as context information (and information they consider
            irrelevant has) will also speak to the significance (or lack thereof) of their work.
            Languages, including ontological languages are not written or read in a vacuum, and
            a seemingly simple predicate such as 'hasContextInformation' can easily acquire additional
            layers of meaning in use.
         </div>
         <div class="para e126">A common thread running through all of these problems is the relationship between
            terms' meanings and the contexts in which they're applied. Each application of an
            ontological term such as 'hasRepresentationInformation' or 'hasContextInformation'
            can reinforce or redefine that term's meaning. Our research team had lengthy discussions
            on issues such as whether something was 
            <div class="emphasis e127" role="under">really</div> representation information or whether it was something else.  Should documentation
            of the architecture of an Intel processor-based personal computer be considered representation
            information for a binary executable (for surely apprehension of the full system architecture
            is necessary to completely understand how an op code will be interpreted) or is it
            contextual information (for surely historians of tomorrow will want to understand
            the complex interplays between game design and computer architectures)? Or is it both?
            Or neither?  These discussions were the beginning of a process by which the meaning
            of our ontology's terms were defined and refined by our somewhat localized community
            of practice, but they were not the end of that process. Like any other language development
            process, the application of our ontology will be a process in which our community
            negotiates to achieve a shared, if imperfect, common understanding of the ontology's
            terms' meaning.
         </div>
         <div class="para e128">Viewing the semantics of an OWL ontology as an example of language activity in which
            meaning of terms is socially constructed and variable is fine if you are a linguist
            interested in pragmatics, but somewhat problematic from the point of view of a preservationist;
            if the meaning of ontological terms is socially constructed, I cannot assume that
            this process will magically end when the ontology is published; it is more likely
            that the meaning derived from these terms by humans will continue to be redefined
            and reinterpreted. What if the meaning of the ontological terms I have created suffer
            linguistic drift over the next 100 or 500 years? If I'm employing an ontological language
            to convey to users what documents they need to obtain to decipher a bit stream, how
            can I help insure that they understand the language I'm using to express those thoughts
            today, when I cannot be assured they will be interpreting the terms in the same way
            I am?

            within our culture. Enabling this, however, requires that those in the future be able
            to make sense of our knowledge management framework. How do we approach the problem
            of enabling people to make sense of digital information when the frameworks we use
            for managing that information involve terminology that are problematic to interpret

         <div class="para e133">I cannot claim to have the solution to these problems, but the nature of the problems
            we experienced with Preserving Virtual Worlds I believe points to at least a few parameters
            that need to be part of our solution.  The first is to develop an account of meaning

                     meaning is constructed through a variety of communicative interplays in society, and
                     is not innate or static.

            These characteristics of much modern work on pragmatics align nicely with our observations
            of ontology use in the Preserving Virtual Worlds project. Specific ontological terms
            in our project originated within the Open Archival Information System Reference Model,
            but as we applied our ontology and packaging standards, we found that our practice
            was somewhat at odds with the original formal definition, which is to say, our team
            constructed a somewhat different meaning for the terms than they originally had. Linguistic
            theory which accounts for and explains these linguistic practices in a manner more
            sophisticated manner than labeling them 'noise' or 'transmission error' is necessary
            to plan for preservation systems which mitigate misunderstandings caused by linguistic
            change over time.

            for that activity in knowledge management systems design. Failure to do so will lead
            to brittle systems which do not perform well outside of a very limited setting.

            packaging does make one thing clear: the users of the future cannot and will not be
            able to decipher the meaning of our ontological terms separate from seeing their application
            in practice, and if semantic variation and change over time is going to be made visible
            and explicit to our users, then a fundamental aspect of digital preservation systems
            must become preserving information about the preservation system itself, including
            the XML languages used within the system.  And given the social nature of language
            use, such preservation cannot take the form of simply saving versions of specific
            vocabularies as they are changed over time.  We will need to preserve records of the
            actual use of markup languages over time so that if necessary users can examine the
            historical record of our markup languages' development.

         <div class="para e154">Those of us working in digital preservation need to remember that our job is to support
            individuals in making sense of the historical record of digital materials, that such

            of sources, and that making sense of the historical record requires making sense of
            what preservationists have done with the historical record. What I am arguing for
            here is an effort to preserve information about our preservation systems that extends
            well beyond traditional archival notions of provenance. We need a record of not only
            the specific actions we have taken with a historical object, but documentation of
            the larger socio-technical systems in which an object has been housed, categorized,
            discussed, reformatted, linked and disseminated. Making sense of the past will require
            making sense of the preservation systems, and without a record of those systems and
            their use, including markup technologies, such a sense-making project is inconceivable.
