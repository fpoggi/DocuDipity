            <div class="para e7">Publishers have a history of managing data for the long-term.  In the past this meant
               warehouses of proof sheets.  As the publishing process became electronic, assets were
               archived on tape or disk in the event of a need to re-release (perhaps due to a popular
               subsequent movie or other event).  However, the challenge shifted from storage of
               materials to file compatibility and management of software versions.  Then along came
               XML, which offered a vendor-agnostic format in which to, at a minimum, archive data
               if not becoming the format in which the data was authored.  Now that publishers find
               themselves in the midst of an eBook boom they find themselves, yet again, dealing
               with managing different formats and, to complicate matters, dealing with different
               implementations of the same standard.  This paper will discuss the current state of
               the trade, textbook, and journal publishing industry as it pertains to creating eBooks
               for current and backlist resources.  It will also discuss the challenges faced by
               publishers as the technology continues to move forward toward “enhanced eBooks” at
               a pace faster than the standards can be updated.

            include: 1) new revenue streams; 2) new income from older assets; and, 3) being seen
            as a technology leader. The challenges are just as numerous, if not more so: 1) conversions
            of data to one or more formats; 2) an environment where new devices seem to appear
            almost weekly; 3) issues in pricing and distribution; 4) creation of new multimedia
            content to accompany previously available text.  The differences in tha capabilities
            between the Kindle and the iPad illustrate the opportunities and challenges for publishers.

                  It is based on the Mobipocket standard, with a slightly different serial number scheme
                  and its own Digital Rights Management (DRM) formatting. It is perhaps somewhat ironic
                  that the Mobipocket e-book format is based on the OEBPS standard.  It uses XHTML and
                  can include JavaScript and frames. It also supports native SQL queries to be used
                  with embedded databases. Notably, Eastern European letters with diacritical marks
                  and Pacific rim characters are not supported.  AZW files can also be reflowed, just

                  standard form for storing and editing printed publishable documents. Because PDF documents
                  can easily be viewed and printed by users on a variety of computer platforms, they
                  are very common on the World Wide Web. The specification of the format is available

               </div>
               <div class="para e61">The format is designed to reproduce page images, therefore text traditionally could
                  not be re-flowed to fit the screen width or size. As a result PDF files designed for
                  printing on standard paper sizes are less easily viewed on screens with limited size
                  or resolution, such as those found on mobile phones and PDAs. Adobe has addressed
                  this by adding a re-flow facility to its Acrobat Reader software, but for this to
                  work the document must be marked for re-flowing at creation, which means existing
                  PDF documents will not benefit unless they are tagged and resaved.

            <div class="para e64">There are many different eBook reader devices available and seemingly more every day.
               These devices can be divided into 2 basic classes.  The first is based on an E Ink
               electronic paper display.  These displays can currently only show shades of gray (although
               research is being done on color E Ink), are viewable in direct sunlight, and require
               no power to maintain a static image. There is no back lighting, which reduces eye
               strain, but makes them unreadable in the dark. The Amazon Kindle and Sony Reader are
               examples of this class of reader.  Many within this class of reader can play MP3 and
               other types of audio files. The second class uses backlit LCD screens and are often
               more than dedicated eBook reading devices.  For this project 8 devices were included
               in the test set.  These devices come from both classes and provide a mix of different
               features and capabilities.

               <div class="para e67">Amazon Kindle is a software and hardware platform developed by Amazon.com for the
                  rendering and displaying of e-books and other digital media. It was one of the first
                  widely accepted eBook readers. The Kindle supports several ebook file formats including
                  AZW/MOBI and PDF. The first version of the device was first sold in the U.S. in 2007.
                  The Kindle hardware device uses an E Ink brand electronic paper display that features
                  16 shades of gray and a six inch E Ink display. It downloads content over Amazon's
                  Whispernet.  The Kindle hardware device is used without a computer connection, and
                  Amazon Whispernet is accessible without any monthly fee or wireless subscription.
                  Because the eBooks bought on the Kindle are delivered over its wireless system, the
                  user does not see the AZW files during the download process.

               <div class="para e68">Kindle software applications exist for Windows, iOS, BlackBerry, Android and Mac OS
                  X. This allows Kindle content to be read on devices running any of these operating
                  systems. In software updates released in June 2010, capabilities were added to the
                  Kindle software applications that are not supported by the Kindle device, most noteably
                  the inclusion of audio and video. In doing so, Amazon created a requirement for graceful
                  degradation within eBook files. Through a technology called "Whispersync," customers
                  can connect reading progress, bookmarks, and other information across Kindle hardware
                  devices and other mobile devices.

                  to work extremely well with their data format.  The Kindle also has access to perhaps
                  the largest online bookstore, as well as various independent sources and free content
                  providers.  Also, for some time, Amazon was seen as the industry leader and therefore
                  able to dictate to publishers what the prices on eBooks should be. With the advent
                  of the Apple iPad, Amazon has been working to add more online capabilities to the
                  Kindle device, such as an improved browser and social networking applications such

            available source material.  This allows the final product to be freely distributed
            without concern for licensing issues.

            <div class="para e130">The text conversion from OSIS XML to XHTML for inclusion in the eBook file appeared
               to be fairly straightforward at first glance.  However, further analysis revealed
               that there was a minimal amount of structure contained within the file. Also, the
               entire Bible was contained within a single file. The snippet below shows many of the

            <div class="para e132">Within this &lt;p&gt; element, we see &lt;verse&gt; and &lt;chapter&gt; elements.  However, these tags
               are simply empty boundary markers, denoted by the sID (e.g. line 5) and eID (e.g.
               line 6) attributes.  Notice the verse end (line 2) and the chapter end (line 3) and
               beginning (line 4) at the start of the &lt;p&gt;.  The &lt;milestone&gt; element (line 8) marks
               the beginning of the anchor text, but the end of the text is identified by the &lt;note&gt;
               start tag (line 9).  In many cases, &lt;note&gt; elements do not have &lt;milestone&gt; elements
               to identify any text.  Also notice the &lt;q&gt; (quote) elements.  The starting indicator
               (line 12) occurs in one “verse” and the ending indicator (line 16) occurs within a
               different “verse”.

            <div class="para e133">These overlapping structures presented a challenge in converting the data to XHTML.
               It was desired that verse numbers be inserted into the text in order to allow readers
               to more easily navigate the text. Since the primary use of the data is for human reading,
               there was not a need to specifically delineate the verse boundaries, as this could
               be determined programmatically later, if needed. Also paragraphs would be kept intact
               as much as possible.
            </div>
            <div class="para e134">The process of converting the OSIS markup took several steps.  First of all, an XSLT
               stylesheet was written that attempted to convert the OSIS markup into nested XHTML
               structure.  The stylesheet processed the beginning and ending marker elements and
               converted them to character sequences within the output text.  The stylesheet also
               created the separate files for each chapter.  Since output from the stylesheet needed
               to be well-formed in order to be processed further by other stylesheets, angle brackets
               were replaced with "~~" to delineate markup.  Some markup was also removed including
               the verse ends.

            </div>
            <div class="para e138">Finally another XSLT script took the well-formed XML source file to prepare the files
               needed to build the EPUB collection. Spans with class attributes were also added into
               the markup to allow CSS formatting of the text. For example the span with the “jesus”
               class (formerly &lt;q&gt; markup) allows for red-letter marking of the words of Jesus on
               eBook readers that display color. Each book, chapter and verse were also given IDs
               to provide anchor points for linking (e.g. footnote returns).  Since milestones do
               not occur consistently, it was decided to drop them and simply insert a marker indicating
               that a footnote is present.  In cases where quotes span over several paragraphs or
               chapters, the quotes are closed at the end of the larger structure and restarted in
               the preceding one.  For example, the quote was closed at the end of each verse and
               reopened after the next verse number markup had been inserted.  This prevents the
               verse numbers from being displayed in red. The single XML was divided into individual
               files, each containing one chapter.
            </div>
            <div class="para e139">Two different methods were considered for footnotes.  In the first method, footnotes
               would be displayed separately from the text, but be linked via a footnote marker.
               The footnotes were extracted from the source XML and stored in a separate file with
               bi-directional links from the source to the footnotes and from the footnotes back
               to the referring source.  The markup shown below is an example of the final product
               of the source text and its associated footnote.

               One problem that was encountered in using this format was the tendency of human readers
               to hit the "previous page" button, thinking it was a back button.  This would turn
               the previous page in the footnotes section of the book, rather than returning back
               to the original text.

            <div class="para e141">In the second footnote scenario, embedded footnotes were used to keep the information
               together and reduce the need for jumping back and forth (and confusion about the use

               to work well on grayscale devices.

            <div class="para e143">In addition to the preparation of the source text, the final stylesheet also generated
               several metadata files needed to construct a valid EPUB file.  This includes the OSF
               file which contains the Dublin Core metadata, the file manifest and the spine (which
               lists the files in the order in which they appear).  An NCX file is also generated
               which is used by the eBook reader to present the table of contents.  Some readers
               are able to present collapsible TOCs, so it is important to nest the entries in order
               to allow that functionality when possible.

            <div class="para e146">Artists through the ages have used the Bible as a source for subject matter.  Since
               the source text contains no illustrations at all, a method was developed to insert

               of the source material (approximately 350 images) was found on a website of the LaVista
               Church of Christ.  These images are mostly black and white which will display well

            <div class="para e152">In most eBook readers, when searching capability is provided, it only indexes the
               PCDATA text, not attribute values.  In order to make navigation of the Bible file
               easier, it was suggested that hidden text be added at each book, chapter, and verse
               containing alternate search strings that would allow users to go directly to any anchor
               point.  This hidden text would also allow alternate spellings and abbreviations to
               be used, making navigation even more intuitive.  For example, a reference to Paul's
               second letter to Timothy, could be entered by a user as “2 Timothy”, "2nd Timothy”,
               “II Timothy”, “2 Tim”, “2nd Tim”, “II Tim”, etc.  These different variations are added
               to each anchor point in a &lt;span&gt; element with an class attribute set to “hidden”.
               The CSS stylesheet then attempts to hide the text, while making it searchable.  Our
               Luke example with the hidden text is shown below.

                  		  were putting their gifts into the treasury.
                  		&lt;span id="Luke.21.2" class="verse"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;     
                  		&lt;span class="hidden"&gt;Luke 21:2&lt;/span&gt; He saw a certain poor widow casting in two

               In designing this functionality, it was already known that most of the first generation
               readers (nook, Kindle, Sony) would not be able to perform this task.  Therefore, a
               new facet of the project was introduced: the ability to specify which features to

               of a verse is the &lt;span class='verse'&gt; markup.  Once the appropriate starting point
               is located in the tree, each text node until the following verse marker is examined
               to determine if it contains the value in the name attribute.  If so, an HTML &lt;a&gt; element
               is wrapped around the text pointed to a coordinate in Google Maps.  When the link

               <div class="para e166">As mentioned in the previous section, the hidden text worked differently in different
                  devices.  Therefore, it too, might be a candidate for the include/don't include list.
                  As this concept was considered further, it seemed that almost any of the additional
                  functionality beyond the straight text could be managed in this fashion.  This would
                  also allow differences in functionality to be recognized and items inserted based
                  on the target device.  Another example of this might be to have colorized versions
                  of the graphics for the readers with color screens and black and white for the gray
                  scale displays. While device specific builds allow the production of EPUB files that
                  are more efficient with space by not including data that a device cannot use, it also
                  increases the complexity of distribution.  For example, the devices that support the
                  Adobe DRM can interchange eBooks between them, but have different capabilities. It
                  would not make sense to add capabilities for the eDGe to a file that was being distributed
                  on the Barnes &amp; Noble site, since most buyers would be plannig to use the nook.
               </div>
               <div class="para e167">In addition, Amazon has also added to the debate.  When they updated the platform-specific
                  Kindle software applications in June, they introduced capabilities that are not supported
                  on the current Kindle devices.  They do not allow publishers to upload different versions
                  of the the files to the Amozon website.  This forces publishers to adopt a strategy
                  of graceful degradation within books in which they want to add audio and video capabilites.
                  Graceful degradation essentially means that there is markup that identifies enhanced
                  capabilities and the devices or software must know to either attempto handle the markup
                  or ignore it.  If the markup is to be ignored, information can be provided to let
                  the reader know that they might be missing something.

            <div class="para e171">Another hallmark of enhanced eBooks is the use of multimedia resources to improve
               the reading experience. Many people believe that EPUB does not support media, which
               is simply wrong.  The EPUB supports inclusion of different media types and can select
               the appropriate player based on the mimtype given to a particular file.  The limitation
               is most often with the reading devices themselves.  The Kindle device does not include
               codecs for video, while the iPad cannot run Flash. Both of these can be embedded into
               an EPUB file..
            </div>
            <div class="para e172">There is some debate in the eBook community about the best way to include media files
               in EPUB files.  There are essentially two options: 1) include the files in the EPUB
               file itself; 2) reference the resources via HTML &lt;a&gt; tags.  Each option has its benefits
               and drawbacks.
            </div>
            <div class="para e173">The inclusion of the files in the EPUB file assures that the resource is available,
               whether the eBook reader is online or not.  It also reduces the reliance on a web
               browser to retrieve the information.  It is also faster since there is not delay while
               waiting to download.  The chief drawback is the impact this has on the EPUB file itself.
               As mentioned earlier, the EPUB file is essentially a zip file with a specified set
               up internal files and a “.epub” file suffix.  Most audio and video formats are already
               compressed, so therefore they do not compress significantly inside the EPUB file.
               This requires memory overhead to open the files inside the readers.  It also requires
               longer download times for the books when they are first loaded onto the eBook reader.
            </div>
            <div class="para e174">Referencing files produces smaller EPUB files, but requires a mechanism (usually a
               web browser) to retrieve and present the resources.  This requires that the eBook
               reader be online.  There will also be a lag between the time the link is selected
               and the resource is downloaded.  This is especially noticeable with large video files.

            possible additions have already been considered.  This work will be used to test possible
            updates to the EPUB standard being considered now.  We would like to include inter
            eBook reference which allow the reader to start in one eBook and open another.  This
            would be useful in this context for reference materials such as concordances, dictionaries,
            topical indexes, biblical names lists, etc.

            It also highlighted the various ways in which the implementation of the same standard
            can lead to inconsistent results, which brings into question the effectiveness of
            the standard in the first place.  In a market that is new and largely consumer oriented,
            these inconsistencies can only increase confusion. It would seem imperative that the
