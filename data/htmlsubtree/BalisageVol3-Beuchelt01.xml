            <div class="para e7">Health data interoperability issues limit the expected benefits of Electronic
               Health Record (EHR) systems. Ideally, the medical history of a patient is recorded
               in a set of digital continuity of care documents which are securely available to the
               patient and their care providers on demand. The history of electronic health data
               standards includes multiple standards organizations, differing goals, and ongoing
               efforts to reconcile the various specifications. Existing standards define a format
               that is too complex for exchanging health data effectively. We propose hData, a
               simple XML-based framework to describe health information. hData addresses the
               complexities of the current HL7 Clinical Document Architecture (CDA). hData is an
               XML design that can be completely validated by modern XML editors and is explicitly
               designed for extensibility to address future health information exchange needs.
               hData applies established best practices for XML document architectures to the
               health domain, thereby facilitating interoperability, increasing software developer
               productivity, and thus reducing the cost for creating and maintaining EHR
               technologies.

            outlines how our approach can be aligned with the existing work in the field of

            <div class="para e63">Electronic documentation of health care data is currently at the heart of the U.S.
               national discussion on healthcare reform. While there is no universally accepted
               definition of an Electronic Health Record (EHR), we follow the common approach of
               referring to the entirety of the electronic data about a single patient as the
               complete EHR, while the data stored in a single system is referred to as the
               Electronic Medical Record (EMR) [
               <div class="xref e64" linkend="ref1"></div>] [
               <div class="xref e65" linkend="ref2"></div>].
               Electronic Health Record Systems (EHR Systems) have existed since the 1960s with the
               introduction of MUMPS [
               <div class="xref e66" linkend="ref3"></div>] and have benefited from the
               information technology advancements of the last 40 years. However, health data
               exchange interoperability and other usability issues have plagued system-wide
               adoption [
               <div class="xref e67" linkend="ref4"></div>] and have thus limited the expected benefits. As of
               2009, adoption rates in the U.S. have been as low as 11% for hospitals [
               <div class="xref e68" linkend="ref5"></div>] while only 17% of all U.S. physicians have access to an EHR
               System [

            <div class="para e70">For achieving quality outcomes and economic efficiencies, summary of care
               information plays a special role. Ideally, the entire relevant medical history of
               a
               patient is recorded in a set of summary of care documents securely available to
               patients and their clinicians on demand. This way, the entire care team gets the
               same exact and complete picture of the patient’s health data, without costly
               repeated examinations, duplicate lab tests, and partially reported conditions or
               results (reported to one physician, but absent from another physician’s
               records).

            <div class="para e73">Health Level Seven (HL7) is a health standards organization whose work focused on
               health data standards by creating the clinical document architecture (CDA) [
               <div class="xref e74" linkend="ref7"></div>]. The CDA was created with complete coverage of edge cases in
               mind: using the CDA, one can expect to address nearly all documentation needs in any
               health care system. Consequently, this approach made the schema extremely flexible
               but overly complex, hard to implement in an interoperable design, and difficult to
               manage. In the meantime, the Massachusetts Medical Society and others created a
               simpler continuity of care record (CCR), not based on the CDA. Eventually, another
               standards organization, ASTM International, adopted the CCR as its proposed
               continuity of care record standard [

               CCR and encoding them in the CDA, with the resulting standard being called the
               Continuity of Care Document (CCD). As part of the U.S. national initiative in Health
               Information Technology (HIT), the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) and
               its affiliated Health Information Technology Standards Panel (HITSP) recommended
               that the CCD be used as an input standard for creating a national continuity of care
               standard. The result was initially published as the HITSP Construct 32 standard
               (C32) [
               <div class="xref e77" linkend="ref9"></div>]. The module content and supporting vocabularies were
               recently migrated to HITSP documents C80 [

               reference to C80 and C83. The entire document suite has been significantly expanded
               and has grown more complex.

               health information exchanges, work on these standards has created useful medical
               domain expertise in the health industry. HITSP has recognized the complexity of the
               existing CDA-based standards and has completed an effort to “streamline” the
               standards and the documentation on how to use them [
               <div class="xref e98" linkend="ref12"></div>]. At the
               heart of this effort lies the definition of HITSP Capabilities and Service
               Collaborations. The Capabilities are essentially profiles of existing HITSP
               Constructs which then map to requirements of the American Recovery and Reinvestment
               Act (ARRA) [

            <div class="para e103">Additionally, the entire existing HITSP framework does not always deliver a
               comprehensive, interoperable set of specifications, thus exacerbating
               interoperability problems. For example, the latest revision of the HITSP C19
               Construct [
               <div class="xref e104" linkend="ref16"></div>] references Integrating the Health Enterprise

               <div class="xref e105" linkend="ref17"></div>]and relies on ITI-TF 2, section 3.40, “Provide X-User Assertion” for exchanging
               user attributes. Section 3.40 is a very loose profile of using restricted SAML 2.0
               assertions [
               <div class="xref e106" linkend="ref18"></div>] with WS-Security [
               <div class="xref e107" linkend="ref19"></div>] and
               WS-Trust 1.3 [
               <div class="xref e108" linkend="ref20"></div>]. It is unclear why WS-Trust was chosen over
               the SAML 2.0 protocol, especially since WS-Trust does not define use case profiles,
               processing rules, or static conformance rules. IHE failed to provide complete use
               case profiles and processing rules in its specification. Omissions like these invite
               vendor-specific interpretations of the underlying standards and—in the absence of
               coordinated, point-to-point interoperability certification testing—will lead
               invariably to non-interoperable solutions.

            <div class="para e131">The hData Record Format (HRF) follows the approach taken by the Open Document
               Format (ODF) [
               <div class="xref e132" linkend="ref23"></div>] and other modern XML file formats: at the
               core of the document is a “root” document containing metadata describing the actual
               medical data documents, which are located within a hierarchy of sections. These
               individual XML documents are referred to as “section documents” and are located
               within a section. Any given section can only contain section-documents of one type
               or other sections. These sections can easily be represented as a file folder
               hierarchy on disk or within a ZIP file, or as web resources. 
            </div>
            <div class="para e133">The hData Record Format was created with extensibility in mind. Since we do not
               expect to be able to address all potential use cases with a single HCP, hData can
               be
               extended by defining new sections for additional XML documents to deliver additional
               functionality with almost no limitations to the format of the extensions. While
               highly desirable, we do not expect that all consumers of hData will be required or,
               indeed, will be capable of parsing all documents, so extensions must be marked as
               mandatory or optional.
            </div>
            <div class="para e134">Finally, the NQF-35 hData Content Profile aims to enhance EHR data quality by
               enforcing strict rules on the non-narrative parts of the record to allow automated
               machine processing. C32 and related formats often use narrative fragments within
               fields that are intended for machine consumption, thus breaking interoperability.
               For example, dates can be specified through descriptive terms such as “a week ago”.
               While there is a requirement to capture the fact that a date is ambiguous, resorting
               to unstructured text creates significant interoperability issues and makes machine
               parsing of EHRs unnecessarily complex. By restricting common data types to
               well-established type definitions, hData lowers the interoperability barrier and
               simplifies the creation of health care software.

               individual documents: existing data (e.g., legacy data, machine generated lab
               results, etc.) can be integrated into an HDR without loss of fidelity by adding a
               section for the legacy data XML documents. Non-XML data can be wrapped either
               through simple transforms where possible, or by encoding the data in a form suitable

            <div class="para e165">The data represented by an hData Record should be simple to exchange from one EHR
               System to another. The hData Record Format lends itself ideally for RESTful
               applications: the same hierarchy that can be represented in a file folder structure
               can transfer directly to a URL hierarchy. With this representation in mind, we
               define a RESTful Application Programming Interface (API) to edit the patient hData
               Record through HTTP at the section and section document level. This approach is much
               more efficient than the complex IHE XDS protocol [
               <div class="xref e166" linkend="ref25"></div>] currently
               proposed for sharing CDA-based health data. 
            </div>
            <div class="para e167">By using the HTTP GET verb, any part of an HRF document can be read: the root
               document is directly accessible through the base URL of the HRF. The root document
               contains all necessary metadata to access the medical information contained in the
               HRF document, including a list of all mandatory and optional document types a parser
               must implement. Each section is accessible as a sub-resource, identified by its
               path-segment, which in turn is used to compute the absolute URL to the section
               resource. A GET operation on the URL of a section (or sub-section) resource returns
               an Atom 1.0 feed of all documents or a feed of its sub-sections. The returned
               results can be filtered by using HTTP headers, such as TE (Transfer Extension)
               headers [
               <div class="xref e168" linkend="ref26"></div>], or other appropriate query parameters. For
               example, a GET on 
               <div class="code e169">/immunizations</div> with If-Modified-Since set to a
               specific date, would only return immunizations that have been administered since a
               given date.
            </div>
            <div class="para e170">Modifications of the HDR are implemented analogously. New section documents can be
               added or modified through PUT or POST operations; DELETE works in the same fashion,
               although we recommend well-defined auditing processes when deleting data from an
               HDR. Again, HTTP headers can be used: ETags are highly useful for PUTs. For example,
               a new allergy can be added to the document by PUTting an allergy document into the
               
               <div class="code e171">/adversereactions/allergies</div> section in the document hierarchy.

            <div class="para e177">In order to maintain interoperability with existing EHR implementations that use
               the C32, we also introduce a mechanism to map between hData and a tightly profiled
               version of the HITSP C32 standard, called the “Lightweight C32.” The “Lightweight
               C32,” or L32 for short, is a specification that bridges between CDA-based
               architectures and hData. There are two “modes” for L32: native and compatibility.
               Both remove some of the ambiguity found in the HITSP standard. A native mode L32
               document can be easily validated against the new L32 XML Schema, which is not
               compliant with the C32 and CDA standards. This is due to the use of xsi:type
               attributes in the L32 that facilitate the creation of a more concrete schema. For
               L32 documents in compatibility mode, these xsi:type attributes can be added via XSLT
               to provide compatibility with the C32 standard. Conversion between native and
               compatibility mode is performed through a simple XLST transform. 
            </div>
            <div class="para e178">L32 provides a simpler path to generate a document that will be C32 conformant,
               and satisfies the requirements of current and proposed EHR legislation in the U.S.
               L32 is currently under development; more information is available on the Project
               hData home page at 
               <div xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" class="link e179" xlink:actuate="onRequest" xlink:show="new" xlink:type="simple">http://projecthdata.org/</div>.
            </div>
            <div class="para e180">Mapping between hData and L32 is achieved through a simple XSLT/XProc process.
               This transformation is necessary since C32 or its descendants are required in
               regulated U.S. EHR Systems. Using this approach, new systems can fully focus on
               leveraging the simplicity and precision of hData, thus eliminating the need to
               maintain the complex organizational knowledge and skills required for consuming or
               producing C32 or other CDA-based constructs. Existing systems can leverage the
               constrained C32 profile and the hData conversion tools to ensure that their
               continuity of care documents are interoperable. Since hData is capable of providing
               all functionality for a CDA-based document system through extensibility, the hData
               format allows for a natural evolution away from the CDA-based document formats. 
            </div>
            <div class="para e181">The L32 alignment approach should not be mistaken for a solution in and of itself.
               The L32 maintains the cumbersome CDA legacy, and cannot address any of the problems
               deriving from its monolithic form. L32 is intended to ease the transition from HITSP
               C32, not to address all of the requirements for a comprehensive EHR health data
               standard. As such, L32 is limited to the continuity of care sections of the NQF-35
               hData Content Profile.

            <div class="para e184">While hData introduces a new approach to the data format and replaces significant
               portions of the existing CDA architecture, it still fits conceptually into the HITSP
               architectural framework [
               <div class="xref e185" linkend="ref15"></div>]. The extensive existing work on
               defining code systems, data standards, data dictionaries, data exchange content, and
               use case scenarios can be leveraged with hData through its simple extension
               mechanism. hData Content Profiles, if hData is eventually adopted, will rely heavily
               on the medical domain knowledge that HITSP and its members have been working on
               successfully for many years.

               <div class="xref e216" linkend="sec1"></div>, a complete EHR is the collection
               of all individual EHRs and EMRs across all health service providers that hold health
               data about a patient. Within the health community, there are many EHR Systems
               operated by different actors, such as health providers, government entities,
               insurance companies, and others. Currently, patients have very limited electronic
               access to their digital health data stored by other actors, and even less active
               control over who can access their health data. Since hData implements RESTful
               patterns, access to hData Records for patients can easily be implemented by giving
               patients access to their data over the internet. Simple stylesheets can be used to
               display the contained data in a human-readable form.
            </div>
            <div class="para e217">In addition, hData web resources can be made discoverable through web-centric
               protocols such as the proposed XRD 1.0 protocol [
               <div class="xref e218" linkend="ref31"></div>]. By using
               discovery mechanisms, patients can effectively link their HDRs in different EHR
               Systems and create a more complete picture of their health data. By using a
               ProtectServe-like authorization scheme, the patient is empowered to authorize access
               to their records based on the identity of the requestor.

                     is important for the DAS to present the patient with reasonable default
