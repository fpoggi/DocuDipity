         <div class="abstract e6">
            <div class="para e7">PubMed Central (PMC) is the US National Library of Medicine's digital archive of life
               sciences journal literature. On average the PMC team processes 14,000 articles per
               month.
               All of the articles are submitted to the archive by publishers in an agreed-upon markup
               format, and the articles are transformed to a common article model. To help reduce
               the
               number of content- or markup-related problems encountered, PMC puts new participating
               journals through an evaluation period that includes both automated and manual checks.
               
            </div>
            <div class="para e8">Once a journal has passed the evaluation stage, it sends its content to PMC on a regular
               production schedule. The production content is processed automatically when it arrives,
               with
               any processing problems generating expected error messages. Although most of the content
               sent to PMC has been through production systems and QA when it was published, we've
               found
               that there is still a level of manual content checking that needs to be done on the
               production content. Any problems found must be investigated to determine if they result
               from
               a problem in the source content, a problem with the PMC ingest transforms, or simply
               a
               problem with our rendering of the normalized XML content. 
            </div>
            <div class="para e9">Having the content in XML certainly has advantages: it can be validated against a
               schema
               and easily manipulated and processed, but XML doesn't solve all of the problems. A
               sharp eye
               and attention to detail are still needed by the production team as they would be for
               any
               publishing process.

         <div class="title e36">The Promise of Marked-up Content</div>
         <div class="para e37">Building a full-text journal article repository seemed like a pretty straightforward
            task
            in when PMC was conceived in 2000. After all, participating journals already had their
            content
            in SGML or XML that they were putting online or sending to a vendor to be put online.
            All we
            would need to do would be to get the marked-up content, render it in PMC, and store
            it. 
         </div>
         <div class="para e38">But we soon found out that the content we were receiving was not of the same quality
            as
            the articles that had been printed or even as the articles showing on the journals'
            websites.
            This seemed odd; the SGML was created for the online product, and this SGML was delivered
            to
            PMC for the archive. At the turn of the century, XML-first publishing workflows (where
            the
            articles are authored in XML or converted to XML as soon as they were submitted to
            a journal
            and then processed as XML) were not the norm.

         <div class="para e59">Things were going pretty well in that workflow up through item 5. The author's keystrokes
            had been used from the original word processing files&amp;#x2014;reducing errors that
            would
            have been introduced by rekeying the article; a person familiar with the content (usually
            at
            least two of a copyeditor, proofreader, or author) checked the files and any changes
            at each
            stage until it was sent off to press. 
         </div>
         <div class="para e60">At this point it is out of the hands of the content folks and into the hands of the
            data
            converters. In step 6, the typesetting files used as the source for the transformation
            contained some information about the structure of the article, but it certainly was
            not enough
            to build a proper SGML/XML representation of the article. Assumptions are made during
            the
            transformation, and a surprising amount of hand tagging - copy and paste - was done
            to create
            the files. The problem areas are not surprising: metadata, tables, and math.
         </div>
         <div class="para e61">From the PMC point of view, the real tragedy in this (generalized and non-specific)
            workflow happens at step 8, when the files are reviewed by a proofreader but corrections
            are
            made to the output HTML files and not back in the source SGML files. Once we started
            processing those SGML files in the young PMC system, we took a close look at the output
            of our
            rendering of the files to identify any problems with the way our system was handling
            the
            files. 
         </div>
         <div class="para e62">We started to find a good number of problems with the supplied SGML that were not
            in the
            HTML version available on the web - and a surprising number that were incorrect on
            the web.
            Unfortunately we did not count the errors that we encountered at this point. We simply
            fixed
            them, reported them to the publisher so that any that also appeared on their site
            could be
            fixed, and moved on the the next article or issue. This is when we knew we would have
            to have
            a team of content specialists checking all of the content we get in PMC.

         <div class="title e76">PMC Philosophy of Text Processing</div>
         <div class="para e77">There are four main principals to the PMC philosophy of text processing</div>
         <div class="para e78">First, we expect to receive marked-up versions of an article that are well-formed,
            valid,
            and accurately represents the article as it was published. We do not go so far as
            requiring
            that the content be true or correct as Syd Bauman illustrates 
            <div class="citation e79" linkend="Bauman01">[Bauman01]</div>, merely that the article represents the version of record.
         </div>
         <div class="para e80">The question of what is the "Version of Record" is left up to the publisher. It may
            be a
            printed copy, a PDF version, or the journal's website. 
         </div>
         <div class="para e81">Unlike the early days of PMC as described above, we do not correct articles or files.
            That
            is, we will not fix something that is wrong in the version of record nor will we make
            a
            correction to an XML file. All problems found in either processing or QA of files
            are reported
            back to the publisher to be corrected and resubmitted. 
         </div>
         <div class="para e82">Thirdly, the goal of PMC is to represent the content of the article and not the formatting
            of the printed page, the PDF, or the journal's website. 
         </div>
         <div class="para e83">And finally, we must run a Quality Assessment on content coming into PMC to ensure
            that
            the content in PMC accurately reflects the article as it was published. Our QA is
            a
            combination of automated checks and manual checking of articles. To help ensure that
            the
            content we are spending time ingesting to PMC is likely to be worthwhile, journals
            must pass
            through an evaluation process before they can send content to PMC in a regular production
            workflow.

         <div class="title e85">The Data Evaluation Process</div>
         <div class="para e86">The data evaluation process has been described previously 
            <div class="citation e87" linkend="Beck01">[Beck01]</div>, but it is integral in ensuring the quality of content that is being
            submitted to PMC.
         </div>
         <div class="para e88">Journals joining PMC must pass two tests. First, the journal must pass PMC's scientific
            quality standard, which means that the journal must be approved for the NLM collection
            by
            NLM's Selection and Acquisitions section 
            <div class="citation e89" linkend="NLM01">[NLM01]</div>. This
            check ensures that the journal's content is "in scope" for a medical library and is
            of
            sufficient scientific quality for the archive.
         </div>
         <div class="para e90">Next the journal must go through a technical evaluation to "be sure that the journal
            can
            routinely supply files of sufficient quality to generate complete and accurate articles
            online
            without the need for human action to correct errors or omissions in the data." 
            <div class="citation e91" linkend="PMC03">[PMC03]</div>
         </div>
         <div class="para e92">For the data evaluation, a journal supplies a set of sample files for approximately
            50
            articles. These files are put through a series of automated and human checks to ensure
            that
            the XML is valid, accurately reflects the publication model of the journal (publication
            dates,
            for example) and is a complete and accurate representation of the published articled.
            There is
            a baseline set of "Minimum Data Requirements" that must be met before the evaluation
            proceeds
            to the more human-intense content accuracy checking

         <div class="para e126">The PMC production team is made up of a set of Journal Managers who are responsible
            for
            the processing and checking of content for the journal titles that are assigned to
            them. We
            use a combination of automated processing checks and manual checking of articles to
            help
            ensure the accuracy of the content in PMC. 
         </div>
         <div class="para e127">We can leverage the fact that all content is sent to us in SGML or XML to eliminate
            any
            article files that are not well-formed (if XML) or valid to the model they claim to
            be valid
            against. 100% of not-well-formed or invalid files are returned to the provider to

         <div class="para e128">The PMC Style Checker (
            <div class="citation e129" linkend="Beck01">[Beck01]</div>) is used during the ingest process to ensure that all content flowing
            into PMC is in the PMC common XML format for loading to the database. The errors provided
            by
            the Style Checker provides us with a level of automated checking on the content itself
            that
            can highlight problems, but it only goes so far. For example, the Style Checker can
            tell you
            if an electronic publication date is tagged completely to PMC Style (contains values
            in year,
            month, and day elements) in a file, but it can't tell you if the values themselves
            are correct
            and actually represent the electronic publication date of the article. 
         </div>
         <div class="para e130">PMC also has a series of automated data integrity checks that run once content is
            loaded
            to the database which can identify, among other things,  problems like duplicate articles
            submitted to the system, and potential discrepancies in issue publication dates for
            a group of
            articles in the same issue.
         </div>
         <div class="para e131">Early in the PMC project the questions of "what and how much to check?" were left
            to the
            discretion of the Journal Manager. But we soon found out that certain things had to
            be checked
            more frequently. All articles with marked-up math (in MathML or LateX) get a close
            review
            because the quality of marked up math has been one of the problem areas since the
            beginning of
            the project. In addition, all published corrections and retractions needed to be checked
            closely to ensure that the tagging provided in the source XML allows PMC to build
            a link
            between the correction/retrction and the article being corrected/retracted. We also
            check the
            ever PDF that we generate for manuscripts being tagged for the NIH Public Access Project
            
            <div class="citation e132" linkend="NIH01">[NIH01]</div>.
         </div>
         <div class="para e133">As the project began to grow, both in terms of the amount of content coming into PMC
            and
            the number of Journal Managers required to manage the content, it became obvious that
            we
            needed to quantify the QA process. First, the production team compiled a "Content
            QA
            checklist" which was a collection of some of the most common (and serious) errors
            encountered
            over the years. Next, we built a system that shows each Journal Manager the journals
            that are
            assigned to him, and which articles need to be checked 
            <div class="xref e134" linkend="F2"></div>. The system
            selects a percentage of articles from each "batch" of new content deposited by the
            journal as
            they are processed and loaded to the PMC database. The number of articles in each
            batch is
            determined by the publication model and participation mode of the journal itself.
            Traditional
            journals which deposit a whole issue at a time into PMC will normally have a "batch"
            consisting of all the articles in the issue. Journals which publishing on a continuous
            basis
            and send content to PMC article-by-article will have batches which reflect how much
            content is
            deposited during a given day.
         </div>
         <div class="para e135">While it would be nice to be able to check 100% of the articles being loaded into
            the PMC
            database, this is generally not reasonable because of resources. So, once an journal
            has
            passed the tightly monitored data evaluation period, and has demonstrated over a period
            of
            time after moving into production that it can provide generally error-free data, QA
            is done on
            more of a spot check basis. By default, new journals that come out of data evaluation
            and move
            into production are set with a higher threshold of articles selected for QA in the
            system.
            Once PMC's Journal Manager is confident in the journal's ability to provide good,
            clean, data,
            the article-selection percentages are lowered over time. Journals with a proven track
            record
            of providing error-free data into PMC generally have lower percentage of articles
            checked for
            QA. If the Journal Manager begins to see problems on an ongoing basis, the percentage
            of
            articles checked may be increased.

            Article Errors are grouped into eight major categories: Article Information, Article

            Quality,
            and PDF Quality. Within each of these major categories, there may be one or more
            sub-categories. For example, in the "Article Body" section there is a subcategory
            for
            "Sections and Subsections", containing errors for mising sections, or sections that
            have been

            she simply
