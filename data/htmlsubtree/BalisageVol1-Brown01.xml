            This paper follows up from an initial note drafted by Andrew
            Townley as a result of discussions held during Pensive's
            research and developer boot camp held in Vienna in July
            2007. The two most important themes discussed were the role and

            during our discussions. These questions will then be addressed

            The goal of this paper is to put forward some ideas in a broader
            forum and elicit feedback and alternative perspectives. It is
            possible that these ideas have already been discussed elsewhere,
            and we are simply not aware of any consensus previously reached
            regarding them. Hopefully, this paper will help to clarify some
            of these issues and lead towards practical solutions.

               Context is one of those concepts that most people feel is
               essential to understanding something, but which sparks great
               debate when one attempts to define it. The main issue in the
               scientific and technical communities revolves around whether
               context should be regarded as subjective or objective [
               <div class="xref e92" linkend="MENZ99"></div>]. Once a decision is made regarding one's
               view on context, there is the question of how to represent it
               computationally.

               <div class="emphasis e94" role="ital">Subjective context</div> is what most people
               understand context to be. It is experiential in nature and
               includes the total of meanings (ideas, assumptions,
               preconceptions and associations) that are related to a thing
               or event and which serve to influence our attitudes,
               judgements, perspectives, and general knowledge of something
               [
               <div class="xref e95" linkend="AKMA00"></div>]. While Menzel argues that
               subjective context always implies an "outer context" which
               exists outside any given context, recursively, that enables
               individuals or intelligent agents to adopt a broader
               perspective to reason about the original context, Bohm's
               theory supports the idea that context and those perceiving it are
               part of a unified whole in much the same way as the observer
               and the observed are related in relativity theory and quantum
               theory [

               The ability to leverage separate views of a given situation is
               often useful or indeed necessary, but we need to be aware that
               these separations are not necessarily accurate or complete
               reflections of reality. They must be seen as simply a useful
               mechanism in a particular domain or situation to aid in

               Barwise, Perry, Seligman and Devlin on Situation Theory and
               Information Flow Theory [
               <div class="xref e101" linkend="MENZ99"></div>]. The focus
               of the objective context is the setting in which the objects
               and available information reside and also encompasses the
               relationships between them. The focus of Menzel's work [
               <div class="xref e102" linkend="MENZ99"></div>] is to define a logic for reasoning within
               objective contexts such that a given statement is true in the
               portion of the real world described by a particular situation
               rather than deal with the complexity of the perceptions and
               assumptions involved in how the participants view a given
               interaction. In order to achieve this, it is necessary to
               create a definition of context which exists outside these
               subjective perceptions and which will remain invariant for all
               the participants.

            <div class="para e103">
               Clearly, both definitions of context are attempting to capture
               information about the environment in which an interaction
               takes place in order that some level of shared understanding
               between the participants be established. However, there is a
               considerable difference in the types of information that would
               be included in each definition. Before determining which
               perspective would be the most useful in terms of sharing
               information and knowledge with the Topic Maps standard, it is
               necessary to consider what the goals really are of including
               contextual information in specific topic maps.

               a truly objective observer attempting to capture an objective
               context would establish each of the "who", "what", "where",
               "when" and "how", but would be unable to capture any meaningful
               understanding of the "why" beyond any surface remarks made
               during the meeting, e.g. "We are here today to finalize the
               implementation plan for Project X". While this may make any
               given context more easily suited to use by autonomous agents and
               deductive reasoning, it may not accurately reflect the complete
               reality of the situation.

               Therefore, the real question is how accurately one wants to
               capture "reality" in a particular context. Akman cites several
               examples where the actions and behaviour in a particular
               situation reflect the dramatically different views of reality
               held by the participants [
               <div class="xref e137" linkend="AKMA00"></div>]. Attempting to understand these interactions from an
               objective perspective would likely result in confusing and
               conflicting interpretations, with the person trying to
               understand the situation asking themselves, "now, why did they
               do that?". Searching for the answer to that particular
               question would truly result in insights and new knowledge for
               the person who asked it.

               In contrast, establishing the subjective context of the same
               meeting would involve some level of understanding the
               participant's 
               <div class="emphasis e139" role="ital">mental models</div>. An
               individual's mental model include all of their experiences,
               beliefs and assumptions about the world. Mental models are
               important to establishing subjective contexts because they
               both reflect and shape an individual's understanding of
               reality [

               intents and attitudes of the participants may dramatically
               alter one's understanding of actions taken and information
               disclosed during the meeting. This information provides the
               answers to the "why" question seemingly ignored by the

               being a true reflection of reality rather than viewing it as
               insights into a given domain and "which are neither true nor
               false but, rather, clear in certain domains, and unclear when
               extended beyond these domains" [
               <div class="xref e145" linkend="BOHM80"></div>]. These insights are shaped by our mental models, and must
               therefore be subjective. According to Bohm, the true reality
               can never be grasped explicitly; it is an implicit whole that
               is exposed through each subjective context. Recognition of
               context as subjective is a key to greater understanding of a
               particular domain, because it is the interactions and
               boundaries of existing contexts that provide new insights of
               understanding into a particular domain.

               It would therefore seem that the subjective interpretation
               	  of context cannot be ignored. Topic maps are a communications medium
               	  to encapsulate and convey information,
               understanding and knowledge about a particular domain. They
               are ultimately created by humans - whether directly authored
               by people or created automatically by software created by
               people - and therefore reflect a subjective view of that
               domain shaped by the implicit factors inherent in any form of
               communication. This means that they will be vulnerable to many
               contextual ambiguities "born out of a misplaced belief on the
               part of the author that the reader has access to the author's
               collective dimension" [

               This vulnerability is potentially problematic because of the
               merging process defined by the Topic Maps specification:
               unlike a document or other work created with a particular
               intention and with assumptions about context shared between
               author and readership, information in a specific topic map can
               find itself far outside the context the original author had in
               mind. Consequently, any implicit or shared context will be
               lost. Since context is so critical to effective communication,
               determining how to best capture it is also critical to
               creating effective Topic Maps.

               It may well be that there are two, arguably conflicting, views
               on the role of topic maps. Is a specific topic map intended as
               something to be studied for greater understanding of a given
               domain, or is it intended to capture a body of information to
               support ad-hoc queries to answer questions about a
               domain—limited only to the information at hand? How this
               question is answered may have significant implications for the
               type of information and manner used in expressing context
               within the instance.

               In the first case, the goal is to engage users so that they
               become active participants in the topic map. In this case, the
               information in the specific topic map would act similarly to
               the text in Paul Auster's literature and become "'a
               springboard for the imagination'" [
               <div class="xref e153" linkend="AKMA00"></div>]. The intended use for the topic map is to help the user
               understand something new about the topic map's domain. Knowing
               as much as possible about the domain-view of those capturing
               the information and relationships - including the ontology -
               of the topic map will greatly enhance the process of
               cross-domain information sharing. In this respect, support
               for a more subjective interpretation of context would be
               valuable.

               level of contextual information captured may not need to be as

               In this respect, working with Topic Maps benefits from the fact that thestandard
               	  does not require content within a particular topic map to conform to
               a fixed ontology. Any ontology used is merely a
               guideline. Therefore, it would seem that Topic Maps has
               potentially the greatest chance of being useful ways of
               capturing knowledge without falling prey to Bohm's theory of
               fragmentation. In his words, "to be confused about what is
               different and what is not, is to be confused about everything"
               [
               <div class="xref e165" linkend="BOHM80"></div>]. The flexibility of Topic Maps
               would tend to allow someone with an awareness of fragmentation
               to be able to view a particular domain and explore the
               relationships not only between the topics and their
               occurrences, but also between the different, fragmentary views
               captured in multiple ontologies. Taken as a device to reason
               
               <div class="emphasis e166" role="ital">about</div> a particular domain, this could be
               an extremely useful feature of the Topic Maps specification.

               In a scenario where an ontology is used to define context, it
               becomes critically important to identify the boundaries or
               context in which a particular ontology applies vs. any other
               ontology. While this may be straightforward enough when using
               explicit ontologies, it will obviously prove to be more of a
               challenge for topic maps using implicit ontologies. In the
               same way that every software system has an architecture,
               explicit or not, so too does every topic map have an
               ontology.

               One of the differences between scope in Topic Maps and infons
               as used by BABY-SIT is that BABY-SIT infons consist of a
               relation, one or more objects corresponding to a role in the
               relationship and a polarity. In this way, they define a
               context (situation) that can be used as a primitive object to
               determine relevance of other relationships and situations
               within the system. While a similar notion could possibly be
               expressed as a Topic Map query, this construct does not seem
               sufficiently rich with which to represent context within a
               specific topic map. However, it could potentially be used as a
               primitive construct within a Topic Map query. It is also not
               clear what implications the introduction of a new context
               representational form may have for existing topic maps.

            <div class="emphasis e247" role="ital">information sharing</div> would
            exclude closed systems under centralized control but rather
            promote a decentralized model, as present in the current World
            Wide Web. However most of the current implementations of the
            Topic Maps standard are proprietary systems running under a
            centralized model. Many Web paradigms can be successfully
            applied to existing Topic Maps implementations in order to meet
            the requirements of large-scale information sharing. Hence
            although Topic Maps is not able to address large-scale
            information sharing directly, it might viably become a standard
            for information sharing if WWW paradigms are embraced,
            potentially creating "Topic Webs".

            The 
            <div class="emphasis e249" role="ital">relation between context and information
               sharing
            </div> was demonstrated through the conclusion that
            if information sharing ought to be addressed through topic maps,
            the adequate capture and representation of context is even more
            important as not only is the overall information space much more
            volatile but also the cultural background of users is likely to
            be much more diverse.

            Furthermore, Topic Maps has 
            <div class="emphasis e251" role="ital">commercial
               opportunities
            </div> in the area of information sharing if
            implementations become less monolithic and evolve more
            independently in order to increase deployment and
            interoperability through e.g. specialized products and aroud communities of use.
            	This is at least the promise of the Topic Maps Reference Model, that
            	anticipates that standards bodies will create Topic Map Applications (TMA) organized
            	around the needs of such communities: "The disclosure of the ontological
            	choices made in those TMAs will enable users across diverse
            	communities to effectively marshal information about subjects
            	indicated differently in diverse communities"

            It is possible that parts of the Topic Maps specifications need
            to be enhanced in order for the standard to be used in
            large-scale information sharing, or when attempting to capture
            appropriate contextual information. Much of the presented
            materials are only ideas and theories that need to be explored
            and tested much more rigorously to determine their validity and
            potential applicability to the target domains, bearing in mind
            "the only principle of the scientific method is that experience
            and observation is the sole and ultimate truth of an idea"
