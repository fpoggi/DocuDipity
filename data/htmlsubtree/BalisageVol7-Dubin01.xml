               to convey a particular meaning, while other content concerns the

         <div class="para e45">The distinction between a digital resource's content and its
            expressive format is usually described in different terms than the
            content/presentation distinction familiar to markup researchers and
            practitioners. In both cases one understands that the same content can
            be formatted or presented in different ways. But the word
            “format” typically connotes a discrete symbolic
            notation—one that might encode conceptual content, structural
            information, presentational instructions, or all three.
            “Presentation” is usually understood as patterns of
            energy or matter that visually or audibly communicate (via shared
            graphical or auditory interpretive conventions) resource structure and
            content to human minds. Standardized and proprietary digital file
            formats are the most familiar of these notations.
         </div>
         <div class="para e46">Proposals for semantic enrichment or digital preservation
            often focus on methods for transforming resources from one format into
            another. Colloquial XML can be transformed into RDF via XSLT 
            
            <div class="xref e47" linkend="sperberg-mcqueen04"></div>, or into horn clause assertions
            through a Prolog application 
            <div class="xref e48" linkend="dubin03"></div>. But although
            notations like RDF and first order logic may admit more expressive
            distinctions than colloquial XML, such transformations at best merely
            re-express resource semantics in a more convenient form for drawing
            inferences or some other purpose“those semantics aren't inherent
            in the notation. The connection between resource and content (i.e., a
            symbol structure and the content it expresses) is always contingent:
            the same symbols might just as easily express different content, or no
            content at all 
            <div class="xref e49" linkend="renear07"></div>. In the context of some particular
            assertion event, correct interpretation of encoded content is typically mediated
            through  many expressive layers. In the following sections,
            we discuss the relationships among content, structure, and
            presentation, and situate them with respect to our ongoing research in
            scientific data management.

         <div class="para e52">This work is part of the Data Conservancy, an ongoing
            scientific data management project funded by the National Science
            Foundation's Office of Cyberinfrastructure 
            
            <div class="xref e53" linkend="choudhury09"></div>. Our aims are to develop formal
            terminology and identity conditions for concepts of general importance
            to the management and use of scientific datasets (e.g., observation,
            data content, version, format, etc.). Our proposed formalizations are
            expressed as terminological axioms in the Description Logic ALC

            <div class="xref e55" linkend="baader03"></div>.
            Although these may later base ontologies that can direct automated
            reasoning over data set descriptions, our current aims are merely
            analytic: we propose, challenge, and revise the models in the context
            of reviewing and informing data curation practices and system design
            decisions. For example, we suggest that a model separating abstract
            propositional content of a scientific assertion from the observation
            event justifying that assertion may ease data integration across a
            series of related studies (e.g., replication of findings):

            propositions are completely abstract, requiring no concrete
            expression. 
            <div class="xref e89" linkend="hayes04"></div>. Propositions standing in the
            same subject, predicate, and object relations are strictly identical.
            On this understanding, different data sets might have exactly the same
            propositional content, but differ in the observations or computations
            that justify their assertions. Similarly, two scientists might appeal
            to exactly the same observation events as justification for very
            different (or even contradictory) assertions.

         <div class="para e92">In the context of our research on scientific data, we view
            resource “content” as propositional in nature.  A
            
            <div class="emphasis e93">proposition</div> is an abstract thing which can be the
            object of propositional attitudes (such as belief or doubt) and the
            bearer of truth values. We consider propositions to be the language
            independent entities that are the meanings of
            those sentences (or other symbol structures) that express them.
            Artistic and literary resources may have forms of non-propositional
            content that are inseparable from the expressive choices of their
            creators, but artistic and literary content are not our focus in this
            study.

                     This type of content corresponds, roughly, to the “work”

            example, with XML declarations, PostScript prologues, and other forms
            of metadata. In the following sections we consider the connections

            propositions to conceptual propositions. Examples of interpretive
            frames include the grammatical rules expressed by an XML Schema, coded
            character sets such as ASCII, the convention of writing numbers as
            strings of Arabic numerals with ten as the implied numerical base, the
            Hierarchical Data Format standard, and all dialects of the English
            language as they are spoken today. Interpretive frames also include
            any systematic expressive choices that may be local to a particular
            digital resource, such as a correspondence between successive rows of
            a spreadsheet and the order of transactions in a scientific

            such as under-documented spreadsheets, in highlighting the

            tools and solutions are lacking. But discussions of these methods tend
            to foreground regularity in a resource's primary expressive structure,

            conversion into a raster PNG file. Strictly speaking, all three
            options preserve the conceptual content for human beings able to
            display the file using viewing software, provided that those viewers
            have an understanding of Tukey's box plot conventions. The current
            PostScript file encodes conceptual content in a declarative notation:
            median, range, hinges, and outliers are expressed in the scale of the
            original data, not the PS/PDF display plane coordinates. Those
            declarations would disappear in a translation from PS to PDF (usually
            understood as a lossless transformation). On the other hand,
            syntactically correct PostScript offers no guarantee of page
            independence (or, for that matter, halting). This PostScript file uses
            a non-embedded font that may not be as commonly available in the
            future as it is today. And the undocumented Postscript-based box plot
            markup language will be unfamiliar to people who might have an
            interest in extracting the data.
         </div>
         <div class="para e165">It would be relatively easy to transform box plot markup
            language into RDF, preserving all of the conceptual propositions
            listed above, and avoiding the shortcomings of PostScript, PDF, and
            PNG. Such an RDF re-expression could also include structural
            information, such as that Fisher5 is a box-and-whisker plot. But
            unlike a PDF or PNG translation, the resulting RDF would not express a
            box plot, and the advantages Tukey's notation offers for rapid visual
            assessment and comparison would not be available. We don't mean to
            suggest that this is a dilemma, or that no better migration options
            than these four are available (SVG might offer the best of all of
            them, for example). But interpretive frames would form a backdrop of
            dependencies for any such solution.

            semantics can be used here to give a theoretical grounding for

            addressee, a (space-time) discourse location, and an expression. In
            terms of the framework (axioms) for encoding presented above, the
            speaker is the agent that commits to an expression, the discourse
            location is partially given by the assertion event, and the expression
            is the symbol structure that is the primary expression for the
            systematic assertion indicated in an assertion event. The role of the
            addressee and the end-point of the discourse location are left open
            until the document is viewed by some consumer of the data, only at

            real-world entities referred to by the symbol structures have the
            properties indicated by the relevant set of claims. In other words,
            the described situation is one in which the propositions that are the
            substance of the assertions (and therefore are data content) are all
            true. Since the described situation may not come to pass, we allow for
            data that is in error, by referring to things that do not exist or
            assigning properties to things incorrectly.

         <div class="para e179">In Situations and Attitudes, Barwise and Perry discuss
            
            <div class="emphasis e180" role="ital">resource situations</div>, the situations
            that the actors participating in a discourse situation have access to
            and use to identify and assign referents for the expressions that make
            up an utterance. Interpretive frames, as presented above, are a
            particular kind of resource situation. One kind of interpretive frame
            is the resource situation that govern the mappings between symbol
            structures and the things they refer to. This mapping was discussed by
            Barwise and Perry (and Wickett) as the speaker's 
            <div class="emphasis e181" role="ital">connections</div>. This interpretive frame assigns
            things like identifiers to individual plants in laboratory study, or
            assigns one column of a spreadsheet to a particular property of those
            plants. The preservation of meaning (in translation or simply within a
            single discourse situation) requires that the connections established
            by the addressee of an utterance are the same as those intended by the
            speaker.

         <div class="para e182">XML documents, and digital objects in general, operate as
            communicative artifacts in virtue of a chain of computational
            structures that provide a background in which bitstreams can be
            understood as encoding symbolic structures. These interpretive frames
            are pointed to by things like standards for character encoding and by
            the various standards and specifications for hardware and software
            that allow us to create files and share them across systems. Barwise
            and Perry discuss how in natural language utterances, expressions that
            occur at one point in a discourse situation can supply a 
            <div class="emphasis e183" role="ital">setting</div> that influences how expressions that
            occur at another point in the discourse situation are understood. We
            can understand the interpretive frames that govern things like
            character encodings as resource situations that supply the necessary
            settings under which bitstreams can be interpreted as characters.

         <div class="para e186">One of the goals of the Data Conservancy project is to
            support interoperability of scientific data products. An interoperable
            data product is one for which given any addressee (consumer of the
            data product), the set of connections that link the symbol structures
            to referents (objects of study, properties, values, etc.) are the same
            as those intended by the agent that indicated those symbol structures
            in the original assertion event. Representing structural propositions
            directly, either by asserting them (as with metadata annotations) or
            expressing them via encoding technologies like XML is one part of our
            strategy for helping to achieve this goal. Documentation of
            interpretive frames that connect propositions at different abstraction
            levels is another part of that same strategy. 
         </div>
         <div class="para e187">We can see an application of these ideas in the OAIS
            Reference Model, which requires the inclusion of
            “representation information” as part of an Archival
            Information Package. This representation information is intended to
            give “information necessary to render and understand the bit
            sequences constituting the Content Data Object” 
            
            <div class="xref e188" linkend="lavoie04"></div>. However, it is important to draw a
            distinction between an interpretive frame and documentation of the
            frame. While OAIS representation information is necessary and can
            provide documentation of important aspects of the interpretive frames
            against which some data object is created, it must itself be in the
            form of a symbolic structure. On our view, interpretive frames
            are abstract mappings that correspond roughly to a 
            
            <div class="emphasis e189" role="ital">situation</div> 
            <div class="xref e190" linkend="barwise83"></div>. 
            Therefore documentation can express
            elements of an interpretive frame, but a document cannot, by itself,
            
            <div class="emphasis e191" role="ital">be</div> an interpretive frame.

         <div class="para e194">Document markup solutions already do a better job than other
            notations in explicating structural content, and connecting it to
            appropriate interpretive frames. XML documents begin by declaring what
            they are, which encoding governs the interpretation of bit patterns,
            and (typically) what schema provides a syntax for the document. XML
            metadata applications offer numerous other forms of documentation and
            linking to bridge interpretive gaps. Most of the observations we offer
            here can be found stated either directly or indirectly by proponents
            of semantic documentation and enrichment frameworks like Formal Tag
            Set Definition and Intertextual Semantics
            
            <div class="xref e195" linkend="marcoux09"></div>. But professional and research literature
            on markup semantics tends to foreground the role of markup itself in
            licensing inferences 
            <div class="xref e196" linkend="sperberg-mcqueen02"></div>
            
            <div class="xref e197" linkend="sperberg-mcqueen04"></div>
            
            <div class="xref e198" linkend="sperberg-mcqueen11"></div>. Archiving standards like
            OAIS give an impression that “representation
            information” can supply needed interpretations, rather than
            simply document encoding choices. We recommend a different
            emphasis.

         <div class="para e199">In our work with scientific data, the author/researcher's
            assertion event—rather than the resulting expression
            structure—seems to us the locus at which key identities are
            established. According to our axioms, it is these assertions that make
            propositions into data content, and supply symbol structures with
            their contingent meanings. The encoder of a data set can be likened
            (as Wendell Piez has suggested) to the player in a nomic game 
            <div class="xref e200" linkend="piez09"></div>, accepting some responsibility for creating
            the constitutive rules that govern his or her choices.
