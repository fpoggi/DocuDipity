            <div class="para e7">The following paper proposes a model for the encoding of variance in music that is
               based on traditional models and implemented using the data framework offered by the
               Music Encoding Initiative (MEI). It introduces concepts derived from the Functional
               Requirements for Bibliographic Records (FRBR) to music editing. This combination is
               then used to auto-generate proposals for the filiation of sources and to illustrate
               the relationships between the encoded sources. The purpose of this system is to
               structure the editorial process, provide a better overview of the material, and to
               inform the editor's findings. It will be developed and used by the 
               <div class="emphasis e8" role="ital">Freischütz Digital</div> project, the goal of which is to
               create a digital scholarly edition of Carl Maria von Weber's opera

         <div class="title e47">Introduction</div>
         <div class="para e48">The core tasks of a scholarly edition of music are the investigation, documentation,
            and explanation of the transmission of the work. In traditional textual criticism,
            this
            is done by examining all available sources, comparing the textual version(s) they
            contain, tracing the filiation of sources, selecting a main (or "base") source, and
            providing an edited text that resembles the main source as closely as is reasonably
            possible. The textual variation recorded in this process is traditionally documented
            in
            a separate list that identifies readings by movement, measure, and (sometimes) beat
            within the measure and voice. In contrast to traditional print publications, which
            restrict themselves to a single base text because of pragmatic and/or financial
            considerations, in the digital medium one may include all pertinent sources without
            regard to their relevance to filiation. In addition, the determination of a base source,
            and thus a listing of variants compared only to it, is not necessary. The edition
            can
            therefore document all readings, not just a single edited version of the text [
            <div class="xref e49" linkend="bohl2011"></div>]. In fact, it is now possible to provide all historically
            legitimate alternative versions of the text simultaneously.

         <div class="title e51">Musical Variants</div>
         <div class="para e52">Based on earlier literature [
            <div class="xref e53" linkend="feder1987"></div>], German musicologist
            Bernhard R. Appel proposed a systematic model for variants in his article
            
            <div class="quote e54">Variatio delectat – Variatio perturbat</div> [
            <div class="xref e55" linkend="appel2005"></div>,
            pp. 7–24]. He identifies four main types of local variation between sources: 
            <div class="emphasis e56" role="ital">additions</div> (
            <div class="quote e57">Ergänzung</div>), 
            <div class="emphasis e58" role="ital">deletions</div> (
            <div class="quote e59">Streichung</div>), 
            <div class="emphasis e60" role="ital">substitutions</div> (
            <div class="quote e61">Ersetzungen</div>) and 
            <div class="emphasis e62" role="ital">rearrangements</div> (
            <div class="quote e63">Umstellungen</div>). An 
            <div class="emphasis e64" role="ital">addition</div> denotes the introduction of new material to the musical text,
            as compared with an older version (AB ⇒ AXB). In contrast, a 
            <div class="emphasis e65" role="ital">deletion</div> is characterized by leaving out parts of the text (ABC ⇒ AC). A
            variant where a portion of the musical text is replaced by another is identified as
            a
            
            <div class="emphasis e66" role="ital">substitution</div> (ABC ⇒ AXC). In this case, the
            original portion and its replacement may differ in length. In the last species of
            variant, 
            <div class="emphasis e67" role="ital">rearrangements</div>, the musical text itself is not
            changed, but portions are reordered (ABC ⇒ ACB). With regard to their effect on the
            musical text, Appel points out that all variants can be assigned to one of these four
            types.
         </div>
         <div class="para e68">However, considering the fact that the actual filiation of sources is very often all
            but clear [
            <div class="xref e69" linkend="feder1987"></div>, p. 64], 
            <div class="emphasis e70" role="ital">additions</div> and 
            <div class="emphasis e71" role="ital">deletions</div> may be
            consolidated into a larger category. That is, when it is not possible to establish
            the
            direction of dependency between two sources, the only possible observation in both
            cases
            is that one source holds text not present in the other. Therefore, considering both
            
            <div class="emphasis e72" role="ital">additions</div> and 
            <div class="emphasis e73" role="ital">deletions</div> as the exchange of 
            <div class="quote e74">something</div> with
            
            <div class="quote e75">nothing</div>, and thus special cases of 
            <div class="emphasis e76" role="ital">substitution</div>, the number of types may be reduced. A 
            <div class="emphasis e77" role="ital">rearrangement</div> may be thought of as two 
            <div class="emphasis e78" role="ital">substitutions</div> at different positions. What would be lost when taking
            this perspective, though, is the identity of the material omitted in one place and
            inserted at another, so that a 
            <div class="emphasis e79" role="ital">rearrangement</div> requires
            an additional pairing of two atomic 
            <div class="emphasis e80" role="ital">substitutions</div>.
            Therefore, the number of variant types may be reduced to only two—
            <div class="emphasis e81" role="ital">substitutions</div> and 
            <div class="emphasis e82" role="ital">rearrangements</div>.
         </div>
         <div class="para e83">When comparing more than two sources, variants amongst them may also be classified
            by
            another taxonomy. German philology offers the terms 
            <div class="emphasis e84" role="ital">Bindefehler</div> and 
            <div class="emphasis e85" role="ital">Trennfehler</div>. A
            
            <div class="emphasis e86" role="ital">Bindefehler</div> is a variant reading shared by two or
            more, but not all, sources. By sharing a particular variant, the sources are logically
            connected and therefore have a closer filial relationship than sources that do not

            <div class="emphasis e87" role="ital">Trennfehler</div> describes the opposite
            case. It denotes a variant that distinguishes two sources that have been subjected
            to
            either a 
            <div class="emphasis e88" role="ital">substitution</div> (in the broad sense mentioned
            above) or a

            <div class="emphasis e90" role="ital">Trennfehler</div> argues for a distant relationship between sources. A variant
            in the musical text transmitted in at least three sources is therefore always a
            
            <div class="emphasis e91" role="ital">Bindefehler</div> for some of these sources, and a

            that, while common music notation (CMN) features a very clear structure of measures
            and
            staves, the visual structure of music notation does not limit the musical content
            in any
            way and must not be confused with the semantics of the musical content. Composers
            and
            copyists alike have never restricted themselves to changes that do not cross this
            structure. When a melody line is replaced by another, changes to several measures
            may be
            required, without affecting the place of these measures in the context of the notation
            as a whole. Like the conventions of line, paragraph, and page breaks in literary text,
            the visual structures of CMN are simply conventions that facilitate reading and
            writing—no more, no less.

         <div class="title e100">Encoding Variants in MEI</div>
         <div class="para e101">In the case of editorial markup, MEI implements the same concepts and mechanisms as
            TEI (Text Encoding Initiative). Those familiar with TEI can therefore safely assume
            the
            same concepts behind the elements of the same name in MEI. Thus, encoding variance
            in
            MEI is based on use of the 
            <div class="code e102">&lt;app&gt;</div> element, which is allowed at almost
            every level. It identifies a portion of the musical text that varies among different
            sources. Each distinct reading drawn from the available witnesses is held in a
            
            <div class="code e103">&lt;rdg&gt;</div> element that identifies its source or sources using its
            
            <div class="code e104">@source</div> attribute. This model matches the concept of 
            <div class="emphasis e105" role="ital">Bindefehler</div> and 
            <div class="emphasis e106" role="ital">Trennfehler</div>
            almost perfectly. For sources sharing a reading, an 
            <div class="code e107">&lt;app&gt;</div> element
            acts as a 
            <div class="emphasis e108" role="ital">Bindefehler</div>, while in the case of sources
            with different readings, it acts as a 
            <div class="emphasis e109" role="ital">Trennfehler</div>.
         </div>
         <div class="para e110">However, the 
            <div class="code e111">&lt;app&gt;</div> element is not capable of adequately dealing
            with all of the species of variance described earlier. MEI does offer a mechanism
            for
            
            <div class="emphasis e112" role="ital">additions</div>, 
            <div class="emphasis e113" role="ital">deletions</div>, and 
            <div class="emphasis e114" role="ital">substitutions</div>; that is,
            
            <div class="code e115">&lt;add&gt;</div>, 
            <div class="code e116">&lt;del&gt;</div> and 
            <div class="code e117">&lt;subst&gt;</div>
            elements. However, these elements are intended to describe scribal processes within
            a
            given witness, not variation across multiple sources. The more generic
            
            <div class="code e118">&lt;app&gt;</div> element could be used, which is designated to describe
            variance of this kind as shown in the following encoding:
            
            <div class="programlisting e119" xml:space="preserve">
               &lt;app&gt;
               	           &lt;rdg xml:id="rdgA" source="#A"/&gt;
               	           &lt;rdg xml:id="rdgB" source="#B"&gt;
               		       &lt;!-- additional content --&gt;
               	           &lt;/rdg&gt;
               &lt;/app&gt;
               
            </div>
            A complete example of an additional measure in source 
            <div class="emphasis e120" role="ital">B</div>
            including musical content might look like this:
            
            <div class="programlisting e121" xml:space="preserve">
               &lt;section&gt;
               &lt;measure n="26"&gt;...&lt;/measure&gt;
               &lt;app&gt;
               &lt;rdg xml:id="rdgA" source="#A"/&gt;
               &lt;rdg xml:id="rdgB" source="#B"&gt;
               &lt;measure n="26b"&gt;
               &lt;staff&gt;
               &lt;layer n="1"&gt;
               &lt;note pname="c" oct="5" dur="4" dots="1"/&gt;
               &lt;note pname="b" oct="4" dur="8"/&gt;
               &lt;note pname="d" oct="5" dur="4"/&gt;
               &lt;rest dur="4"/&gt;
               &lt;/layer&gt;
               &lt;/staff&gt;
               &lt;/measure&gt;
               &lt;/rdg&gt;
               &lt;/app&gt;
               &lt;measure n="27"/&gt;
               &lt;/section&gt;
               
            </div>
            This approach works for 
            <div class="emphasis e122" role="ital">substitutions</div> but it falls
            short on 
            <div class="emphasis e123" role="ital">rearrangements</div>. Here, it can only capture two
            seemingly separate operations (
            <div class="emphasis e124" role="ital">deletion</div> and subsequent
            
            <div class="emphasis e125" role="ital">addition</div>) in separate 
            <div class="code e126">&lt;app&gt;</div>
            elements. To circumvent this restriction, additional markup is necessary.
         </div>
         <div class="para e127">Because the identification of a 
            <div class="emphasis e128" role="ital">rearrangement</div>
            requires an additional step of interpretation, which may be made by the editor at
            any
            time in the editorial process, the encoding can begin with the use of two separate
            
            <div class="code e129">&lt;app&gt;</div> elements, but allow for enrichment of the basic markup
            later. The simplest, and thus most useful, solution is to employ the
            
            <div class="code e130">@corresp</div> attribute to cross-link the corresponding
            
            <div class="code e131">&lt;rdg&gt;</div> elements:
            
            <div class="programlisting e132" xml:space="preserve">
               &lt;app&gt;
               	           &lt;rdg xml:id="oldPos" source="#A #B" corresp="#newPos"&gt;
               	           &lt;!-- content at old position --&gt;
               	           &lt;/rdg&gt;
               	           &lt;rdg source="#C"/&gt;
               &lt;/app&gt;
               ...
               &lt;app&gt;
               	           &lt;rdg source="#A #B"/&gt;
               	           &lt;rdg xml:id="newPos" source="#C" corresp="#oldPos"&gt;
               	           &lt;!-- content at new position --&gt;
               	           &lt;/rdg&gt;
               &lt;/app&gt;
               
            </div>
            Using these mechanisms clearly shows that the parallel segmentation method of
            
            <div class="code e133">&lt;app&gt;</div> and 
            <div class="code e134">&lt;rdg&gt;</div> suffices to address musical
            variants occurring inside musical structures.

         <div class="para e140">However, as mentioned earlier, 
            <div class="emphasis e141" role="ital">substitutions</div> (of
            melodies, for example) often ignore the structural features of music notation like
            measures and staves (see 
            <div class="xref e142" linkend="example1"></div>). In the given scenario, the musical
            notation, as encoded in MEI, requires splitting the description of variance into two
            separate 
            <div class="code e143">&lt;app&gt;</div> elements. This separation does not resemble a
            
            <div class="quote e144">Befund</div>, which obviously permits only one difference between the two
            sources. The fact that the change crosses the bar line results in a typical example
            of
            overlapping hierarchy issues confronted by any XML-based encoding system. For the
            encoding of the musical text, MEI is well prepared to handle such overlaps. For
            instance, slurs, one of the most common features of CMN that interfere with measure
            and
            staff structures, can be captured using various markup possibilities, including
            attribute-based milestone techniques and standoff markup.
         </div>
         <div class="para e145">For 
            <div class="quote e146">overlapping</div> variants that interfere with the notational structure

            for
            
            <div class="emphasis e147" role="ital">rearrangements</div> may be used. The difference here is
            that instead of relating the descendant 
            <div class="code e148">&lt;rdg&gt;</div> elements, the
            
            <div class="code e149">&lt;app&gt;</div> elements themselves should be connected. Capturing cross
            references with 
            <div class="code e150">@xml:id</div> and 
            <div class="code e151">@corresp</div> attributes is less than
            ideal, however, as double-ended references can result in largely redundant pointers
            requiring careful maintenance. For example, consider that even a small change in a
            measure may affect a large number of staves.

            <div class="code e155">&lt;delSpan&gt;</div>, etc.) is of no help
            here, as CMN is a two-dimensional notation, making it impossible to describe an affected
            region of the text with just one start and one end point. Instead, a standoff approach
            allowing only single-direction pointers is more appropriate. The obvious solution
            would
            be to use the 
            <div class="code e156">&lt;annot&gt;</div> element (the MEI equivalent to TEI’s
            
            <div class="code e157">&lt;note&gt;</div>), which offers a 
            <div class="code e158">@plist</div> (participant list)
            attribute. The 
            <div class="code e159">&lt;annot&gt;</div> element could be used to point to all related

            <div class="code e161">@type</div> attribute could be
            used to identify its purpose. However, this solution also falls short with regard
            to
            explicitness. A standoff methodology explicitly identifying all relevant components
            is
            clearly the best strategy. But using generic 
            <div class="code e162">&lt;annot&gt;</div> elements,
            distinguished only by simple typing, for all these specific cases, overloads its

            in 1998. It does not offer a ready-to-use data format, but rather generic concepts
            that
            help to create cataloging formats that address advanced user needs. As the FRBR
            terminology is also applicable to music philology, especially with regard to the
            filiation of sources, it has been adopted by MEI for its 2013 release.
         </div>
         <div class="para e182">FRBR is organized into three separate but related entity groups. Only the first group,
            which provides work, expression, manifestation and item entities, has been adopted
            by
            MEI so far. These four so-called 
            <div class="quote e183">Group 1</div> entities provide a clear
            terminology for dealing with the transmission of a work in manuscripts and prints
            alike.
            While a work entity represents only the conceptual idea of a musical piece, independent
            from the details of its composition, such as its instrumentation, an expression
            identifies a slightly less abstract entity that does include these details. In other
            words, it also denotes a specific version of the text, even though this requires a
            manifestation (MEI uses its pre-existing 
            <div class="code e184">&lt;source&gt;</div> element for this
            entity) for its materialization. An item is a distinct physical instantiation of a
            manifestation, for example, a copy of a certain print.
         </div>
         <div class="para e185">FRBR also allows specification of the relationships between the basic entities. In
            MEI, some of the hierarchical relations are implicitly encoded using inheritance (an
            expression for example is a child element of a work) while others, such as those between
            expressions and manifestations, are dealt with using pointers. This change in approach
            is necessitated by the many-to-many relationships that can exist between expressions
            and
            sources. For example, a single expression of a work may be transmitted by many sources
            or a single source may contain multiple expressions of one or more works. FRBR offers
            a
            number of relation types, which establish an entity-relationship-model for bibliographic
            and editorial needs. For example, an expression may be described as a translation
            or
            
            <div class="emphasis e186" role="ital">rearrangement</div> of another and a print may be
            identified as a copy of a manuscript source. These relations, however, clearly denote
            the overall relation between two affected entities—they are not operating at the level
            of individual variants, but on the global level of complete objects.
         </div>
         <div class="para e187">We believe the recommended types for relationships identified and provided by FRBR
            are
            also useful to describe processes behind textual variation at more granular levels.
            For
            example, 
            <div class="quote e188">isSupplementOf</div> may be used for 
            <div class="emphasis e189" role="ital">additions</div>, 
            <div class="quote e190">isAbridgementOf</div> for 
            <div class="emphasis e191" role="ital">deletions</div>, 
            <div class="quote e192">isRevisionOf</div> for substitions and
            
            <div class="quote e193">isReconfigurationOf</div> for 
            <div class="emphasis e194" role="ital">rearrangements</div>. Adding such relations to individual textual variants is
            required to give a better overview of the arguments for a specific filiation of sources.
            The suggested implementation mostly relies on existing MEI models. The only important
            change is to allow the 
            <div class="code e195">@rel</div> attribute, which is currently only available on
            the 
            <div class="code e196">&lt;relation&gt;</div> element to describe full-entity relations stored in
            the header, to be used on 
            <div class="code e197">&lt;rdg&gt;</div> elements. In this implementation,
            material added in a later and derived version of the text would be encoded so:
         </div>
         <div class="programlisting e198" xml:space="preserve">
            &lt;app&gt;
            	           &lt;rdg xml:id="rdgA" source="#A"/&gt;
            	           &lt;rdg xml:id="rdgB" source="#B" rel="isSupplementOf" target="#rdgA"&gt;
            		       &lt;!-- additional content --&gt;
            	           &lt;/rdg&gt;
            &lt;/app&gt;
            
         </div>
         <div class="para e199">The example shows how one reading is identified as an 
            <div class="emphasis e200" role="ital">addition</div> to another. The empty reading serves as a placeholder for the
            
            <div class="quote e201">base text</div>. By adding 
            <div class="code e202">@cert</div> and 
            <div class="code e203">@evidence</div>
            attributes to 
            <div class="code e204">&lt;rdg&gt;</div>, the editor may also state the reliability of his
            assessment. While at some point in the future it may be necessary to allow an alternate
            encoding method that employs dedicated elements in order to capture divergent
            interpretation from multiple editors, the simple approach described here will
            suffice.
         </div>
         <div class="para e205">The purpose of filiation is to identify the relations (and their directionalities)
            between sources and to create a stemma that illustrates these relations. The results
            may
            be expressed with FRBR, but they are based on the evaluation of individual variants
            as
            described above. This evaluation, stored in a FRBR-compliant way, can be used to provide
            a better overview of all arguments and to inform the editor's interpretation of the
            overall connection. It may also help to better explore the filiation of sources with
            multiple intermingled ancestors and other complex situations often overlooked in
            traditional filiation [
            <div class="xref e206" linkend="feder1987"></div>]. However, a fully automated analysis
            of those variants seems impossible; simply quantifying the number of variants indicating
            a filiation from A to B vs. arguments for B to A is not particularly helpful, as some
            arguments are more convincing than others [
            <div class="xref e207" linkend="feder1987"></div>, p. 58]. The
            swapping of two pitches has nearly no persuasiveness with regard to the derivation,
            whereas a missing note in a manuscript is an almost unquestionable argument that it
            was
            copied from the source to which it is compared. To make full use of the encoding,
            it is
            therefore important to assess the impact of a particular variant based on the content
            of
            the readings it holds. Following this reasoning, a variant holding an additional staff
            in one source and no corresponding material in another should be given more weight
            than
            a variant where the sources differ only on the pitch of a single note. Likewise, a
            variant affecting substantial information of the text is more compelling than a
            variation in the accidental layer of the text [
            <div class="xref e208" linkend="greg1950"></div>]. Accurately
            judging the impact of a variant by an automated examination is clearly a large-scale
            project of its own, but it is fairly easy to get a first suggestion from less ambitious
            algorithms. When considering the fact that the final evaluation must be based on the
            editor's experience and judgment, it seems unnecessary to get a perfect analysis—it
            just
            needs to be good enough to be a helpful starting point. Under these circumstances,
            it
            seems logical not to hard-wire the weight given to each category of argument, but
            instead to let the editor balance them according to his expertise.
         </div>
         <div class="para e209">An automated analysis of the variation across multiple sources must start with a
            listing of all 
            <div class="emphasis e210" role="ital">Trennfehler</div> and 
            <div class="emphasis e211" role="ital">Bindefehler</div> for every combination of two sources. At this stage, the
            variants do not require further argumentation and stand on their own. An initial graph
            grouping the sources by their level of conformance with each other is already possible.
            However, in order to assess the edges of this graph, the content of these variants
            must
            be evaluated. Simple pitch changes (which may be nothing more than mere copying errors),
            will be treated differently than larger groups of non-corresponding measures. After
            measuring the strength of these arguments, the next step is to identify their
            directions. This process is also based on an evaluation of the content—is it more
            likely
            that the textual difference is a later addition to a formerly shorter text, or is
            it
            more likely that something has been canceled from a formerly richer text? Again, these
            arguments will differ in their persuasiveness, but here the situation is much better,
            as
            additional information can be used to inform the determination of direction. For
            example, if both sources can be precisely dated, the direction is already clear.
            Likewise, the identification of scribal hands may help to determine filiation when
            more
            information about the scribe, such as birth and death dates or work locations, is
            available.
         </div>
         <div class="para e212">Even when the general relationship between two sources seems to be clear, based on
            a
            number of arguments regarded as indisputable, it is important that all contradictory
            variants remain available to the editor, as they may hint at a possible contamination
            of
            sources. Accordingly, the graphical interface for this analysis needs to differentiate
            between parts of these sources and provide hints if there is a significant variation
            in
            the likely directionality of filiation amongst them. Very often, editors will be able
            to
            identify the filiation of sources very quickly. The purpose of an automated analysis
            like this is to ensure that editors do not overlook possible alternatives or mixed
            relationships, resulting in oversimplification of the filiations. Having the editor's
            judgment explicitly recorded in 
            <div class="code e213">@rel</div> attributes on 
            <div class="code e214">&lt;rdg&gt;</div>
            and a determination of a level of certainty for the assertion in 
            <div class="code e215">@cert</div>
            attributes, permits better decision-making, ultimately making the edition more
            transparent for the user.

            <div class="xref e232" linkend="example3"></div>), but compared to regular piano
            roll notation, it is scaled down to a barely legible size, similar to Edward Tufte's
            sparklines concept [
            <div class="xref e233" linkend="tufte2008"></div>]. The idea is to provide an overview of
            large segments of the source. Every source is assigned a distinct color. Everything
            shown in black is shared amongst all sources, whereas the colored parts show the
            differences between them. Piano roll notation represents only the substantial parts
            of
            the score, ignoring accidental components like articulation, dynamics, etc. In a proper
            visualization, this kind of information is provided in a separate stream for every
            staff. This stream could also be reduced, showing only a dot for each accidental sign
            (not visible in the examples). Separation into multiple streams helps to distinguish
            the
            kind of variance even at this high-level overview stage. In the future, scaling may
            also
            be provided in this view, allowing the user to zoom into more and more detail,
            terminating in the actual notation. Until then, this visualization provides an excellent
