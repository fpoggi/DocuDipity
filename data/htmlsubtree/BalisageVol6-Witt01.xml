            representation format such as XML alone is not sufficient. Though XML is being said
            to
            be human-readable it is obvious that legibility is a rather problematic notion in
            terms
            of photos encoded in SVG, complex structures generated from data dumps of databases
            and
            other applications or even formats such as Office Open XML. In the linguistic data
            community, various flavours of stand-off annotation also demonstrate the complexity
            
            of the problem.

         <div class="para e66"> Usually these data formats are not meant to be read by humans, though the advantages
            mentioned in XML-introductions still hold, namely, that data modelled according to

         <div class="title e68">Case Study: The Project “Sustainability of Linguistic Resources”</div>
         <div class="para e69"> This section briefly presents SPLICR, the Web-based Sustainability Platform for
            Linguistic Corpora and Resources aimed at researchers who work in Linguistics or
            Computational Linguistics: a comprehensive database of metadata records can be explored
            and searched in order to find language resources that could be appropriate for one’s
            specific research needs. SPLICR also provides a graphical interface that enables users
            to query and to visualise corpora. 
         </div>
         <div class="para e70"> The project in which SPLICR was developed aimed at sustainably archiving the language
            resources that were constructed in three collaborative research centres. The groups
            in
            Tübingen (SFB 441: “Linguistic Data Structures”), Hamburg (SFB 538: “Multilingualism”),
            and Potsdam/Berlin (SFB 632: “Information Structure”) built a total of 56 resources
            – corpora and treebanks mostly. According to our estimates it took more than one
            hundred person years to collect and to annotate these datasets. The project had two
            main
            goals: (a) To process and to sustainably archive the resources so that they are still
            available to the research community and other interested parties in five, ten, or
            even
            20 years time. (b) To enable researchers to query the resources both on the level
            of
            their metadata as well as on the level of linguistic annotations. In more general
            terms,
            the main goal was to enable solutions that leverage the interoperability, reusability,
            and sustainability of a large collection of heterogeneous language resources. 
         </div>
         <div class="para e71"> One of the obstacles we were confronted with was providing homogeneous means of
            accessing a large collection of diverse and complex linguistic resources. For this
            purpose we developed several custom tools in order to normalise the corpora and their
            metadata records.

            <div class="title e73">Normalization of Linguistic Resources</div>
            <div class="para e74"> Language resources are nowadays usually built using XML-based representations and
               contain several concurrent annotation layers that correspond to multiple levels of
               linguistic description (e.g., part-of-speech, syntax, coreference). Our approach
               included the normalization of XML-annotated resources, e.g., for cases in which
               corpora use PCDATA content to capture both primary data (i.e., the original text or
               transcription) as well as annotation information (e.g., POS tags). We used a set of
               tools to ensure that only primary data is encoded in PCDATA content and that all
               annotations proper are encoded using XML elements and attributes. 
            </div>
            <div class="para e75"> A second reason for the normalization procedure was that both hierarchical and
               timeline-based corpora needed to be transformed into a common annotation approach,
               because we wanted our users to be able to query both types of resources at the same
               time and in a uniform way. The approach can be compared to the NITE Object Model
               (
               <div class="xref e76" linkend="Carletta2003"></div>): we developed tools that semiautomatically
               split hierarchically annotated corpora that typically consist of a single XML
               document instance into individual files, so that each file represented the
               information related to a single annotation layer; this approach also guaranteed that
               overlapping structures can be represented straightforwardly. Timeline-based corpora
               were also processed in order to separate graph annotations. This approach enabled
               us
               to represent arbitrary types of XML-annotated corpora as individual files, i.e.,
               individual XML element trees. These were encoded as regular XML document instances,
               but, as a single corpus comprises multiple files, there was a need to go beyond the
               functionality offered by typical XML tools to enable us to process multiple files,
               as regular tools work with single files only. The normalization process is
               described in more detail in

               serious consequences with regard to legal issues: due to copyright and personal

               fine-grained access control layer to regulate access by means of user accounts and
               access roles. We had to be able to explicitly specify that a certain user only has
               access to the set of, say, six annotation layers (in this example they might be
               available free of charge for research purposes) but not to the primary data, because
               they might be copyright-protected.

            <div class="para e86"> The generic metadata schema used for SPLICR, named 
               <div class="emphasis e87">eTEI</div>, was
               based on the TEI P4 header and extended by a set of additional requirements. We
               decided to store both eTEI records and also the corpora in an XML database. The
               underlying assumption was that XML-annotated datasets are more sustainable than, for
               example, data stored in a proprietary relational DBMS. The main difference between
               eTEI and other approaches is that the generic eTEI metadata schema, formalized as
               a
               document type definition (DTD), can be applied to five different levels of
               description. One eTEI file contains information on one of the following levels: (1)
               setting (recordings or transcripts of spoken language, describes the situation in
               which the speech or dialogue took place); (2) raw data (e.g., a book, a piece of
               paper, an audio or video recording of a conversation etc.); (3) primary data
               (transcribed speech, digital texts etc.); (4) annotations; (5) a corpus (consists
               of
               primary data with one or more annotation levels). We devised a workflow that helps
               users to edit eTEI records. The workflow’s primary components were the eTEI DTD and
               the Oxygen XML editor. Based on structured annotations contained in the DTD we
               automatically generate an empty XML document with embedded documentation and a
               Schematron schema. The Schematron specification is used to check whether all
               elements and attributes instantiated in an eTEI document conform to the current
               level of metadata description.

               front-end is the part visible to the user and is realized using JSP (Java Server Pages)
               and
               Ajax technology. It runs in the user’s browser and provides functions for searching

               related data. It accesses two different databases, the corpus database and the
               system database, as well as a set of ontologies and additional components. The
               corpus database is an XML database, extended by AnnoLab, an XML/XQuery-based
               corpus query and management framework that was specifically designed to deal with
               multiple possibly concurrent annotation layers, in which all resources and metadata
               are stored. The system database is a relational database that contains all data

               corpora) and access rights. A specific user can only access a specific resource if

               text. Piotr Bański described this technique thoroughly at Balisage 2010 (
               <div class="xref e100" linkend="Banski2010"></div>). Stand-off annotation allows for marking up text
               without altering it by the inclusion of markup. It is the opposite approach to 
               inline or embedded markup that was one of the principle ideas behind SGML and its
               successor XML. The term 
               <div class="emphasis e101">stand-off annotation</div> was introduced
               by Henry Thompson and
               David McKelvie in 1997 (
               <div class="xref e102" linkend="thompsonetal97"></div>), however the principles of
               this technique are even older, since, e.g., the linking mechanisms described in TEI
               P3
               already allowed to mark up texts by linking annotations to text regions. Within the
               last couple of years the use of stand-off markup became predominant, especially for
               complex linguistic annotations.

               Especially very complex tag sets such as OOXML are of very limited use if one does
               not have an application which understands these formats. For almost any given application,
               obtaining and using such
               a piece of software will most probably pose a big problem a few years later.
               Sustainability of software is a whole different topic by itself and is not within
               the scope of this paper. 
            </div>
            <div class="para e162"> As a possible solution for this problem we propose to provide the
               machine-generated XML data in multiple formats. For example, the OOXML document
               can be stored in its native format, in plain text or in Portable
               Document format (PDF). Furthermore, filters can be used to remove those XML elements
               and
               attributes from the machine-generated code that are not necessary. It would be even
               better to transform the machine-generated XML data to established formats such as
               TEI
               (
               <div class="xref e163" linkend="TEI-P5"></div>).

            <div class="para e164"> Other than that, one should provide various descriptions and a thorough
               documentation of the data format, not only providing the schema but also tutorials,
               conceptual descriptions or similar documents for human reimplementation of tools
               operating on the machine-generated XML code.

            <div class="para e167"> In the document lifecycle, especially when taking long-term maintenance and
               archiving into account, it is a common problem that XML tag sets and document
               grammars are being used that are not well established outside the 
               group defining the tagset. The use of XML tags following the insights and beliefs
               of
               the individual who wrote the schema as such does not pose the problem, but the
               interpretation of the schema by somebody reviewing the material later may cause
               problems, because no one else knows and understands the implicit logical constraints
               of tag and attribute names as well as data structures. 
            </div>
            <div class="para e168"> The usual answer to the use of proprietary tag sets would be not to use them at
               all and to replace them by standard annotation schemas and tagsets wherever
               possible. For example TEI (
               <div class="xref e169" linkend="TEI-P5"></div>), tagsets developed in the
               context of the standardization processes of ISO TC 37 SC 4 (“Language Resources”)
               or
               DocBook for technical articles and texts (see 
               <div class="xref e170" linkend="Walsh1999"></div>) come to
               mind. However, these tagsets do not always fit the given problem very well and using
               them often results in the well-known problem of tag abuse: tags are used in
               unintended ways or – even worse – users confuse the semantics of tags
               with their intended use. In these cases the results are bound to be more confusing
               than starting from an idiosyncratic tagset. Therefore, if users decide to use one
               of
               the established tagsets they should thoughtfully select the most appropriate one for
               a
               given problem. 
            </div>
            <div class="para e171"> More critical are those cases in which for various reasons no established tagset
               is used. Reasons for not selecting established tagsets range from not knowing about
               tagsets, not understanding tagsets, via policy reasons to the unavailability of
               appropriate tagsets. For example commercial terminological applications may use a
               data model that is consistent with established standards (such as 
               <div class="xref e172" linkend="ISO_16642"></div> in combination with 
               <div class="xref e173" linkend="ISO_30042"></div>) but use a
               native XML format that is very similar but utilises different generic identifiers
               (for
               example SDL Trados MultiTerm 2009 shows this behaviour). The reason for this does
               not lie
               in the technology, but in management decisions. In each of these cases it is not
               sufficient to include the document grammar only to achieve valid XML, but further
               documentation is required. The basic idea is to document everything. 
            </div>
            <div class="para e174"> One way of approaching this problem is by providing a reference in the element
               description to an ontology or some other form of knowledge representation to define
               the data types with possible values. Data types here refer both to XML elements and
               attributes, similar to data types used in XML schema. The reference to the external
               definition of the elements allows for a human user to evaluate the correctness of
               the semantic interpretation, possibly also to automatically evaluate the content
               using a parser. With external definitions the data types are unambiguously
               described according to available means. 
            </div>
            <div class="para e175"> The definition by reference is only one part of the definition, for human use it
               is advisable to use a documentation with the tag set that uses multiple examples.
               This
               
               <div class="emphasis e176">prototype semantics</div> of a tagset is intended to explain the
               meaning of tags and attributes as applied in a given domain or application. For
               human use it is also recommended to use names that bear a certain meaning, i.e., which
               are easily interpretable by a person reading them. Interpreting and understanding
               element and attribute names and values depends on a common background of the creator
               and user. For example, it is harder if both do not use the same script or language,
               because mutual intelligibility is important.

               data categories have been defined, but the list is open, hence it is possible to
               insert data categories that are needed but not available in the registry yet. The
               registry consists of two parts, a private and a public section. Every data
               category that is defined or used by a project or tagset is first defined in a
               private workspace that is nevertheless part of the registry and can be reused and
               referenced. Data categories that are important for various contexts can then be
               moved from private workspaces to the public area by domain experts. This
               promotion includes a quality assessment of the definitions as well as a check for
               possible redundancy in the registry. By this means consistency and documentation of
               data categories is fostered, together with persistent identifiers of the data
               categories, even in the case of the renaming of elements.

            <div class="para e180"> Based on the idea of persistent category definitions, the

               (CMDI, see 
               <div class="xref e182" linkend="Broeder2010"></div>) was designed. CMDI is intended for
               describing language resources. These resources are of various types and require
               different metadata schemas to appropriately describe the contents in a form that
               allows a human user to understand what kind of resources they have to expect. Most
               of these schemas are far more detailed than traditional metadata schemas from
               archivist containing bibliographical data, but also contain keywords, abstracts,
               subject fields, participants, annotation schemas, etc. For reusability reasons the
               data categories are clustered into 
               <div class="emphasis e183">components</div>, and components
               are combined to other components or to a 
               <div class="emphasis e184">profile</div>, which is more
               or less a metadata schema for a specific type of resource, the components also
               allowing the definition of a value schema for each data category. The data
               categories which are used in the components do not provide their own description,
               but refer to the data category registry, for example ISOcat or Dublin Core, using
               
               URIs. By this procedure, the concrete tag name becomes language, script and
               application independent, because the definition is given in a central repository.

            <div class="title e187">Problem: Availability and Findability</div>
            <div class="para e188"> Many researchers creating language resources are more than willing to share their
               resources with close colleagues upon request. However, for various reasons such as
               personal, privacy or property rights they tend to restrict public access to these
               resources. Furthermore, resources created in research contexts are usually designed
               for
               specific purposes such as the analysis of specific linguistic phenomena. The resource
               itself is
               mostly not visible, because research publications discuss the phenomena and their
               analysis, but usually do not describe the resource in great detail. However, these
               publications are often the only documentation for the existence of the resource and
               describe the rationale behind their creation.
               Hence, accessibility to language resources is a major problem to be dealt with. 
            </div>
            <div class="para e189"> Especially in fields with a large economic interest in linguistic resources, such
               as statistical language processing and machine learning, data centres or distribution
               agencies were created to address the problem of accessibility. These data centres
               provide
               material in large quantities and they use rather flat structures for their data.
               In contrast, resources created by individual research projects and researchers
               are often deeply structured and tend to be much more detailed and complex.
               Data centres have standard procedures for intellectual property rights handling and
               cataloguing resources using bibliographical procedures. Language resources from
               commercially less interesting areas or resources that are deeply structured, can
               hardly be found in these data centres. Even if such resources are accessible
               elsewhere, they cannot be reliably located by general search engines. Most often
               they will only be part of the statistical noise of general search engine results.
               There are some specialized search engines, such as ODIN (see
               
               <div xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" class="link e190" xlink:actuate="onRequest" xlink:show="new" xlink:type="simple">http://www.csufresno.edu/odin</div>) for interlinear glossed text, but
               they usually do not provide users with knowledge about the text type and what kind
               of structures and content to expect in the resource. 
            </div>
            <div class="para e191"> The solution is well-known from the initial ideas around the semantic web: metadata
               descriptions of resources should be used that are based on standards,
               quasi-standards, best practice and which are used for specialized catalogues of
               resources. Providing exhaustive metadata records enables a possible user to
               understanding the structures and content of a resource, not necessarily the document
               grammar, but at least they would give a fair idea on the theory behind it. 
            </div>
            <div class="para e192"> Providing metadata refers to issues of proprietary tagsets and controlled
               vocabulary again. The keywords used to describe a resource ideally refer to a
               conceptual space, in which all concepts are well defined and classified according
               to
               superordinate and subordinate terms. The reference to the concept system or to an
               ontology requires standardized values. Standardized values means that a central,
               accessible structure needs to provide them, i.e., a kind of a registry such as ISOcat.
               
            </div>
            <div class="para e193"> In the process of metadata creation different perspectives can be taken: the
               perspective of the author of the resource, the software engineer, the publisher and
               the person looking for a resource later, to name just a few.
               These different roles in relation to a resource are not mutually exclusive in terms
               of metadata categories, but in the creation process different areas are emphasized.
               For 
               example the publisher will usually be more interested in
               making sure that the copyright is explicitly defined than the user searching for a
               specific resource to be employed for a specific use case. Software engineers will
               be
               interested in technical features, while archivist require bibliographical data. 
            </div>
            <div class="para e194"> For the creation of metadata it is essential to use the perspective of
               prospective users. Though it can be argued that not all possible users and their
               requirements can possibly be anticipated, the perspective of users, especially with
               other backgrounds, helps to include not only technically relevant metadata but also
               descriptive metadata relevant for human users. Technical metadata here means those
               bits of information required by someone implementing tools for processing the data,
               while descriptive metadata refers to those classifications that help a possible user
               to understand the content of a resource before actually seeing it. 
            </div>
            <div class="para e195"> Taking various user groups into account when selecting the descriptive detail of
               metadata also allows the design of structured search engines. Structured search
               engines here refer to search engines not only interpreting the textual content of
               pages but that take into account the structure of the metadata. The intention behind
               using the structure of metadata is to provide search results with a higher
               precision while providing a high recall at the same time, which is not necessarily
               achieved by full text based search engines. 
            </div>
            <div class="para e196"> Additionally it is recommended to make these datasets available through as many
               national and international catalogues and initiatives in the respective field or sub-field
               as
               possible (see 
               <div class="xref e197" linkend="sec-conclusion"></div>) and also to enable harvesting of metadata sets using OAI-PMH. With the help of these
               catalogues
               it is possible to announce the availability of the dataset to the scientific
               community using websites, blogs, etc.

            <div class="title e199">Problem: Selection and Qualification for Long-Term Archiving</div>
            <div class="para e200"> In the past, resources were either available or not, a lot of data was lost due
               to conversion problems, technical failure, etc. For each of these there are
               technical solutions, but a major problem remains in the question: what is worth
               archiving? Resources undergo a life cycle and in general it is agreed that not every
               step in the life cycle is worth being archived. In contrast to that, some resources
               are supposed to be archived, even if they did not reach the archival phase of the
               intended life cycle. Finding formal criteria for deciding upon archiving or not is
               a major
               problem that still remains unsolved, one that might be unsolvable as such. 
            </div>
            <div class="para e201"> Criteria for deciding which resource should be archived fall into different
               categories: status, technical quality, organizational and institutional
               requirements, extent of use, quality evaluation and longevity. Some of these
               criteria depend on each other, but can be evaluated independently and therefore be
               used to measure the need for archiving a resource. 
            </div>
            <div class="para e202"> The status of a resource defines the formal editing status, starting from first
               draft versions to released or published versions, etc. Projects that work with a
               life cycle model in resource creation need to archive those documents that are in
               the archiving phase. Naming conventions and value schemas for the different phases
               
               vary greatly. However, the archive status cannot be the sole criterion,
               because in some projects resources get stuck in an earlier state and do not reach
               the
               publication phase, but considering other criteria, they nevertheless may qualify for
               or even require long-term archiving. 
            </div>
            <div class="para e203"> Especially for technological applications the technical quality can be of prime
               importance. For some testing environments it is sufficient to have a resource that
               is technically adequate and has the correct size, so it can serve as a reference point
               or for testing procedures, algorithms and technologies, even if the content and
               status as such are incomplete and still pending improvement. Consequently, the
               technical quality can be a decisive factor for long-term archiving. 
            </div>
            <div class="para e204"> Institutionalized requirements may force data providers to submit material, for
               example close to the end of a project life, while others are hesitant in providing
               data for various reasons, even if the quality is much higher. These requirements are
               usually negotiated with archivists and partners, but often result in
               archiving the resource regardless of other criteria. 
            </div>
            <div class="para e205"> A resource that is widely used by various groups needs to be archived regardless
               of other factors, because it is used as a reference Ὰ ignoring other criteria
               such as quality and status. One reason could be that it is the only resource
               available or has unique properties. Though the use of a resource by a variety of
               users is complex to evaluate, this criterion seems to be obvious. 
            </div>
            <div class="para e206"> Quality is another factor in an evaluation matrix. In contrast to an approach
               which might be termed a take-whatever-you-can-get approach in archiving, archiving
               material without prior evaluation is not desired, as the information flood becomes
               unmanageable, if not for saving, then for retrieval and search. The assessment can
               be both formal by algorithmic processes that can also provide information on the
               technical quality mentioned before, or by a peer reviewing process. In the latter,
               experts decide on the quality of a resource and based on this judgment a resource
               is
               archived or disregarded. 
            </div>
            <div class="para e207"> Even more problematic but essential is the question of longevity of a resource. A
               resource that is most likely to be usable for a long period of time is supposed to
               be archived. The usability over a long period depends on the application of a
               resource. If the resource answers to demands that are continuously present, then the
               resource needs to be available, hence archived, even if the number of users might
               be
               small. 
            </div>
            <div class="para e208"> When measuring all of these criteria separately it is comparatively easy to
               define a threshold of criteria that need to be fulfilled in order for a resource to
               be archived. The threshold is selected in a way that each criteria can serve as an
               overriding criterion, that is, if one of these criteria mandates archiving, then the
               resource will be archived. But if there is no criteria with this requirement, the
               values can accumulate. If the threshold is not set too low, the resource will then
               be
               archived. 
            </div>
            <div class="para e209"> The ultimate goal for working with resources is of course to achieve a high
               quality resource, that is highly regarded by experts, used and usable for many
               years, and reaches a maturity level that is technically well established, etc.
               However, for most resources there are limitations that are not supposed to interfere
               as knock-out criteria for long-term archiving.

            <div class="title e211">Additional Pitfalls</div>
            <div class="para e212"> Technical sustainability is one aspect of sustainability. Other major aspects are
               organizational sustainability and legal issues – two issues not to be
               underestimated. While the technical sustainability is an engineering task which
               seems to be solved in most cases with semi-automatic migration procedures for
               digital devices, this is not true for organizational and legal aspects.
            </div>
            <div class="para e213">
               
               <div class="xref e214" linkend="Eide2008"></div> claim that organizational sustainability may even be more
               important than technical sustainability, because valuable resources can easily be
               lost when an organization is shut down. They list several examples from cultural
               heritage management, where shutting down museums almost lead to the loss of
               resources, e.g., the Newham case where data was only saved because the staff acted
               quickly and dumped it to floppy disks. Sometimes, the resources also exist on paper
               and
               could be digitized again, but as there is a movement away from paper, this option
               will cease to exist soon. 
            </div>
            <div class="para e215">Organizational sustainability is a rather fragile process because it correlates
               with funding and institutional commitment, which are rather soft and fragile factors.
               
               Due to the structure of funding organizations it is hardly
               possible to receive a statement of commitment for a very long period of time. For
               example, the duration of German collaborative research centres is limited to 12
               years. Other long time programs exist, but it is virtually impossible to find a
               commitment for more than 20 years. Therefore, ventures in sustainability also need
               to consider the organizational aspect with a proper strategy how to guarantee taking
               care
               of resources in the years to come – either by securing continuity of
               the organization itself or by preparing and implementing a proper migration plan for
               resources to a different organization. Preparing for both cases would be even
               better. 
            </div>
            <div class="para e216"> Another issue are legal aspects. Especially in the field of linguistics,
               intellectual property rights create their own set of problems which have to be dealt
               with when thinking about sustainability (see 
               <div class="xref e217" linkend="Lehmberg2008"></div> and
               
               <div class="xref e218" linkend="Zimmermann2007"></div>). These issues are investigated in the context
               of international projects such as CLARIN and META-NET; the current direction is
               to work out licensing models (see 
               <div class="xref e219" linkend="Linden2010"></div> and 
               <div class="xref e220" linkend="Weitzmann2010"></div>). These intellectual property rights issues are
               especially tricky as linguistic resources often cross political and cultural
               borders, hence not only legal issues but also ethical implications are involved.

         <div class="para e223"> Sustainability of language resources is an aspect wanted and needed by data
            providers, users and funders alike. To be able to speak of sustainable resources it
            is
            necessary to make resources available according to defined processes, platforms or
            archives in a reproducible and reliable way. To this end, XML is an essential part
            of a
            complex approach which, additionally, also encompasses other standards on multiple
            levels. These are requirements, but tools and systems, accessible in a reliable manner
            and operating based on standards, are important as well. 
         </div>
         <div class="para e224"> With SPLICR there is a proof-of-concept implementation of large parts of the
            functionality required for sustainability platforms. A platform alone is a node in
            the
            sustainable web of trusted resource repositories, each repository providing
            organizational support, technical infrastructure with archiving technology, and being
            entrusted to use specified procedures to respect privacy and rights of data providers
            while providing non-discriminatory access to the resources according to stated
            procedures and rights holders restrictions. Part of this network is also the cooperation
            of various national and international initiatives. In cases of sustainability a certain
            amount of overlap between these projects is desirable to further foster interoperation
            and reliability of tools, data centres and increase redundant archives, avoiding major
            problems in disaster scenarios. 
         </div>
         <div class="para e225"> All in all it can be said that with a number of international projects such as CLARIN
            and META-NET along with its META-SHARE open resource exchange facility, together with
            the initial implementations of various tools, the development of standards in the
            ISO
            Technical Committee 37, Subcommittee 4 “Language Resources” (see 
            <div xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" class="link e226" xlink:actuate="onRequest" xlink:href="http://www.tc37sc4.org/" xlink:show="new" xlink:type="simple">TC 37 SC 4</div>) and establishment of
            de-facto procedures, the sustainability of language resources is no longer something
            that needs to be argued for. Instead, the situation has changed dramatically, as the
            very real problem of providing sustainable data sets is, by now, firmly anchored in
            academic as well as commercially oriented research centres. With raised awareness
            in
            the community, the continuation of language resource distribution projects and
            institutional support by academic libraries and institutions, chances are more than
            promising for providing sustainable resources, using XML technology and state of the
            art
            processes.
