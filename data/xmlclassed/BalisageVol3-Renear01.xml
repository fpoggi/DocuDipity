            formal constraints. Strings are mathematical constructs that are defined, ultimately, in
            set theoretic terms. They are therefore purely extensional entities constrained by the
            axiom of extensionality, common to all standard set theories. As a consequence, strings
            have all of their non-relational properties essentially and cannot be altered or
            modified in any way. Although we can of course identify functions that map one string to
            another, the existence of such functions does not, by itself, provide a explanation of
            what constitutes the modification of a document. </textual></para><para class="po-block e42 e42"><textual class="po-textual">This consequence is not unique to the definition of a document as a string. Familiar

            we do not have a clear conceptual understanding of what is happening when documents are

            such as "The sentence was changed", but only if we treat these sentences as idioms, as
            we do sentences like "The average plumber has 3.2 children". Such sentences do not have
            compositional semantics or support existential instantiation and there is often little
            systematic guidance for their interpretation. Up until now we have largely avoided these
            problems, relying ad hoc solutions and human intervention. But the increasingly formal
            nature of new semantic approaches to information management and publishing, and the
            continuing minimization of human intervention, will inevitably require us to more
            systematically to develop robust literal interpretations of fundamental concepts.</textual></para></section><section class="po-hcontainer e58 e58"><title class="po-block e59 e59"><textual class="po-textual">An Inconsistent Triad</textual></title><para class="po-block e60 e60"><textual class="po-textual">Consider the following three assertions:</textual></para><itemizedlist class="po-table e61 e61"><listitem class="po-container e62 e62"><para class="po-block e63 e63"><textual class="po-textual">All documents are strings.</textual></para></listitem><listitem class="po-container e64 e64"><para class="po-block e65 e65"><textual class="po-textual">Strings cannot be modified.</textual></para></listitem><listitem class="po-container e66 e66"><para class="po-block e67 e67"><textual class="po-textual">Documents can be modified.</textual></para></listitem></itemizedlist><para class="po-block e68 e68"><textual class="po-textual">As any two of these assertions will together logically imply the negation of the

                is not transitive: while the document qua social object may be constituted by one
                string at one time and a different string at another time, this does not imply that
