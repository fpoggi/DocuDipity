using the DOM. At present, there are at least five well-known tree models for
XML in Java: DOM </textual><xref class="po-milestone e60 e60" linkend="DOM"><textual class="po-textual">Ciao Pippo! Ciao Pippo! Ciao Pippo! Ciao Pippo! Ciao Pippo! Ciao Pippo! Ciao Pippo! Ciao Pippo!

same purpose (the authors of this paper know of at least six such private
APIs). Applications and processors written for one of these models are
generally not usable with other models.</textual></para><para class="po-block e65 e65"><textual class="po-textual">The second problem is </textual><emphasis class="po-inline e66 e66"><textual class="po-textual">interoperability</textual></emphasis><textual class="po-textual">. The first
tree model to appear on the scene has had a first mover advantage. Subsequent
tree model designs have intended to address the shortcomings of the DOM, but
not to interoperate with it (note that both DOM4J and AxiOM later added
optional DOM interface implementations to address this
problem—accepting the disadvantages of the DOM in order to achieve
compatibility in this mode). Knowledge of the tricks and optimizations
appropriate to one model do not transfer to other tree models. Though the
successor models have all positioned themselves as better solutions than the
DOM, they have not been adopted as widely. This is most likely due to the
DOM's first mover advantage, and the consequent network effect: although other
models may have technical advantages that make them more suitable than the DOM
for a given application, in order to use those new models efficiently within
the JVM, all parts of the application need to use the same tree model.
Developers must solve a cruel equation in which the marginal benefits of
switching from the DOM are typically low, whereas the marginal costs are
always high. The alternatives seem to be to write multiple code paths to
achieve the same purpose (with different tree models), or to wrap each node of
each tree model in an application-specific abstraction. Some projects, such as
Woden </textual><xref class="po-milestone e67 e67" linkend="Woden"><textual class="po-textual">Ciao Pippo! Ciao Pippo! Ciao Pippo! Ciao Pippo! Ciao Pippo! Ciao Pippo! Ciao Pippo! Ciao Pippo!

"basic" abstractions (node types), compared to eleven in the Infoset, and

variability</textual></emphasis><textual class="po-textual">. Each model exposes different property sets. The
boundaries between lexical, syntactic, and semantic are drawn at different
points. One consequence of this variability is that it is difficult or awkward
to add support for specifications "higher in the stack." For instance, XPath
1.0 </textual><xref class="po-milestone e77 e77" linkend="XPath1"><textual class="po-textual">Ciao Pippo! Ciao Pippo! Ciao Pippo! Ciao Pippo! Ciao Pippo! Ciao Pippo! Ciao Pippo! Ciao Pippo!

perfectly adequately as external tools (one per tree model, or by generalizing

but in a fashion that is not noted for ease of use, and the module is not
widely implemented. Similar situations exist for specifications such as XQuery
1.0, XPath 2.0, and XSLT 2.0. Even SOAP/XMLP is arguably under-supported.
AxiOM, after all, is an entire XML tree model built largely so that the SOAP
abstractions could be represented cleanly as extensions.</textual></para><para class="po-block e81 e81"><textual class="po-textual">Finally, the problem of </textual><emphasis class="po-inline e82 e82"><textual class="po-textual">weight</textual></emphasis><textual class="po-textual"> plagues most of

Sucessor models have done better in this area. Dennis Sosnoski's evaluation,
"Document Models Part 1: Performance" </textual><xref class="po-milestone e86 e86" linkend="DMPerf"><textual class="po-textual">Ciao Pippo! Ciao Pippo! Ciao Pippo! Ciao Pippo! Ciao Pippo! Ciao Pippo! Ciao Pippo! Ciao Pippo! Ciao</textual></xref><textual class="po-textual">, though dated,
provides an excellent illustration of this problem. A large part of the
problem lies in the unrestricted mutability of these models. All of the
prominent XML tree models for Java must restrict programming to serial,
synchronous access. A mutable tree model is effectively a mutable collection,
so any changes made to it by a single writer may have disastrous effects upon
multiple readers. Issues of weight cannot easily be addressed by storing the
bulk of the document on disk, or by concurrent processing, because the
document may be modified during processing.</textual></para><para class="po-block e87 e87"><textual class="po-textual">There are alternatives: applications and processors with higher
performance requirements are often written to abstractions that do not model
XML as a tree, such as SAX, StAX, or XML data binding (in its various
flavors). Sosnoski's article discusses some of these alternatives; Harold's
presentation also notes both advantages and disadvantages. The chief drawback
to these approaches is that they expose paradigms which are not as easily or
intuitively understood as the tree model, which are more of a challenge for
some developers. A tree model is preferred. A single model for navigation and
interrogation seems best. To date, attempts to create this single model have
proven suboptimal in most environments.</textual></para></section><section class="po-hcontainer e88 e88" xml:id="gxml-overview"><title class="po-block e89 e89"><textual class="po-textual">gXML Design Considerations</textual></title><para class="po-block e90 e90"><textual class="po-textual">gXML is a new API for analyzing, creating, and manipulating XML in Java.

well-defined set of operations over an abstraction (the handle), which may
then be adapted to specific implementations (the body). For gXML, the primary
"handles" are the Model or Cursor, the Processing Context, the Node Factory in

the significant additional weight added by the necessity to wrap every node in
a tree. Although there is a cost (in memory and performance) to using the
handles rather than directly manipulating the bodies, the benefits (in
flexibility and capability) are more nearly commensurate: in exchange for a
memory/performance impact measured in low single-digit percentages (for most tree
model APIs), an application or processor gains the ability to manipulate all
supported tree model APIs (currently three; more are anticipated).</textual></para><para class="po-block e106 e106"><textual class="po-textual">There are a number of attractive consequences of using
this design pattern. First, since applications and processors need not write
separate code paths for different tree models, these models can be injected
very late, even at runtime. That suggests that they can be compared, based on
the application's or processor's requirements, and the tree model best suited
to the problem at hand preferred. It also suggests that application and
processor developers might have a sounder foundation to suggest improvements
to developers of the models. Second, by bringing peace to these warring

desire to have a Java API that embodied the XQuery Data Model.  The XDM is
more rigorous than its predecessor, the XML Infoset specification (which
was driven in part from a need to model existing APIs, including DOM, SAX,
XPath, and Namespaces in XML).  It is conceptually complete, and defined in
a context that permits type definition, navigation operations, and more
advanced functions.  This rigorous, well-defined specification was adopted
as the basis for the API, and represents gXML's answer to the problem of
variability.  Is a property or concept in the XDM specification?  Then it
should be in the gXML API.  If it is not in the specification, then either
it should not be exposed in the API, or it should be compatible with the
well-specified API. For instance, the entire mutable API was added as an
extension; XQuery does not define operations that modify trees.</textual></para><para class="po-block e119 e119"><textual class="po-textual">Another important reason to adopt the XQuery Data Model is that it
provides the first well-integrated access to XML Schema information
(one might argue that XQuery and XSLT2 provide the "missing language" for
the XML Schema type system).  A great deal of XML processing has no need to
concern itself with validation, typing, and particularly with the post-Schema
validation infoset; those applications and processors that need it, however,
need it very badly.  gXML defines a common model for XML Schema, compatible
with the XDM's definition and use of XML Schema types and typed values, as a
standard extension.</textual></para><para class="po-block e120 e120"><textual class="po-textual">gXML is not the only model to provide support for XML Schema, but the

adherence to and conformance with the XQuery Data Model Specification, gXML

given XML instance document are never modified. These nodes need not be
mutable—but because some nodes are modified in the common paradigm of
XML processing, all nodes must be defined to be mutable. The core gXML API
dispenses with mutability. Instead, it promotes a paradigm in which a received
or generated XML document is an input, and the XML supplied to other processes
(in the same VM, on the same machine, or somewhere else on the network) is a
transformation of the input. This approach addresses the problem of weight. In
combination with the enabling of custom, potentially domain-specific XML tree
models accessed via a gXML bridge, the immutable paradigm (over an immutable
tree model) can achieve optimizations not possible for a tree model in which
the existence of mutability militates against caching, compaction, and
deferred loading. It is not possible, at this point, to quantify the potential
performance benefits rigorously because the pure-immutable model remains
hypothetical (other priorities have taken precedence). Here we
speculate.</textual></para><para class="po-block e124 e124"><textual class="po-textual">Such a hypothetical immutable model would not need to guard against
modification of a document in one thread while another thread reads it.  It
would provide guarantees that would permit processing of large documents to
be parallelized; an immutable, late-loading model might be able to provide
access to XML documents of a size infeasible for mutable models.  A certain
number of these optimizations are available even for bridges over mutable
models; if the convention encourages immutability, then processors can define
their operations only when the convention is adhered to, warning users that
breaking the convention may lead to undefined (and incorrect) results.</textual></para><para class="po-block e125 e125"><textual class="po-textual">Immutability enables performance enhancements—for instance,
models in memory which occupy a fraction of the size of the XML as a character
stream rather than a multiple of its size; concurrent processing of XML
documents; storage of the bulk of a document on disk with indexing and a very
light footprint in memory. We've noticed unanticipated potential as well: if
there is no requirement to modify the document in memory, then a gXML bridge
may reasonably be defined over any structured hierarchical data format
analagous to XML: JSON, CSV, a file system, a MIME multipart message. Perhaps
more strikingly, immutable models can potentially cross the VM boundary, via
JNI to other languages, into hardware accelerators, and so on.</textual></para></section></section><section class="po-hcontainer e126 e126" xml:id="gxml-apis"><title class="po-block e127 e127"><textual class="po-textual">The gXML Core</textual></title><para class="po-block e128 e128"><textual class="po-textual">The gXML API is designed for rapid understanding.

processor is a code library that performs some specific, well-described

phrase: "serializer," "parser," "converter," "validator," "transformer,"
"signer," and so on. A processor is distinguished from an "application," which
may create (generate), destroy (consume), modify, and otherwise manipulate XML
in multiple steps. Where a processor contributes special functionality to the
performance of a goal, the application oversees and orchestrates achievement
of the goal from receipt to completion. To further distinguish, a bridge
provides the abstraction over which the applications and processors operate,
including the model, input/output, and a context that associates related
tree-specific functions.</textual></para><section class="po-hcontainer e394 e394" xml:id="stateful-processing"><title class="po-block e395 e395"><textual class="po-textual">Stateful</textual></title><para class="po-block e396 e396"><textual class="po-textual">gXML processors may be divided, for purposes of discussion, into two

an example of multi-tree abstraction: wrapper classes permit Woden to

required about a month, but the result seemed a dramatic validation of of gXML
principles and design: the lines of code (LOC) count was reduced by about 15%,
inconsistencies in the handling of DOM versus AxiOM were eliminated, and
supported models grew from two to five (including DOM, AxiOM, the Cx reference

receiving, analyzing, generating/transforming, analyzing further. Creation of
new documents is potentially expensive; this is apt to lead developers to
minimize occurrences of the event. Awareness of this issue, in our experience,

change the paradigms for XML processing in Java, and to enable a host of
additional opportunities for advancing the state of the art. We have discussed
the API, bridges, and processors in some detail, above. Now, let's examine the
further opportunities that gXML enables.</textual></para><para class="po-block e467 e467"><textual class="po-textual">Because gXML encourages the practice of dependency inversion, of
injecting a particular tree model (bridge) at runtime, it effectively
bypasses—even leverages, by inclusion of a bridge for the DOM in the
distribution—the DOM network effect that has presented Java developers
of XML processors and applications with a Hobson's choice: choose a tree model
which is technically superior or less awkward to program against but lose
interoperability with the vast majority of existing processors and
applications, or choose the DOM with its peculiarities and quirks and
limitations but gain interoperability with the wider XML ecosystem. Developers
of alternative Java XML tree models will (we hope) welcome this, and
contribute bridges. Moreover, by permitting this late binding of the tree
model, gXML enables use-case specific comparisons of models to each other.
This capability for comparison, without losing interoperability, may lead to
wider adoption of one or more of the successor models, in one application
domain or across domains. Further, given the ability to compare two models in
such a way, application and processor developers can provide clear test cases
demonstrating issues, which developers of the tree model may find more
compelling, more deserving of attention, than is currently the case when any
comparison must first develop a custom framework/harness.</textual></para><para class="po-block e468 e468"><textual class="po-textual">By enabling injection of the model, gXML also potentially permits the
development of domain-specific tree models, optimized for particular use
cases. Such "niche" models are actively discouraged in the current state of
the art: they lead in the direction of private code, difficult to learn and
difficult to maintain. AxiOM provides an example of a domain-specific model
that has survived the process of marginalization; one might argue that it has
done so in part through its strong association with the high-profile project
Apache Axis 2. Other domains such as strongly typed XML, large XML
processing, and XML in constrained memory environments come to mind as
potential targets. Customization and optimization are possible both for the
underlying tree model, and for the bridge implementation. There is no
restriction against implementing multiple bridges for a single underlying tree
model—since the pattern is injection, two significantly different
bridge implementations over the same underlying tree model may be used by a
single application. Here again, there are significant opportunities for domain
optimization, in this case by optimizing the bridge implementation rather than
changing the underlying tree model.</textual></para><para class="po-block e469 e469"><textual class="po-textual">gXML's championing of the immutable paradigm for XML processing carries
powerful potentials for performance enhancements. We cannot, at this point,
quantify these benefits (they may even be chimerical), but we have seen
immutability adopted in other areas specifically in order to improve
performance. Immutability provides guarantees that enable concurrent
processing, an increasingly common requirement for applications and processors
that must scale to handle large volumes of traffic. With a custom tree model
(even an immutable implementation of the DOM, potentially), the notorious
impact of XML on memory can potentially be reduced. For applications and
processors that already address multiple tree models, significant reductions
in code size may accompany improved performance and consistency. Our
experience suggests that restating problems as transformation rather than
mutation tends to lead to cleaner, better-encapsulated, and typically more
performant code.</textual></para><para class="po-block e470 e470"><textual class="po-textual">One particular area in which gXML holds enormous promise is in the
processing of "large XML". This is, in a way, the same problem as processing
XML with "constrained memory;" whether one identifies the XML as too-large, or
memory as too-small, the problem is the same. How can XML be processed if it
is too large to fit at once into memory? The obvious answer is a custom tree
model, but this answer immediately presents the developer with the DOM "Hobson's
choice" outlined above. gXML removes that issue; a processor or application
programmed against the gXML API can inject a simple, mature tree model for
most processing, or a custom, stored-to-disk, low-memory tree model when the
size of the target document exceeds a specified threshold.</textual></para><para class="po-block e471 e471"><textual class="po-textual">Developers of technologies that compete with XML as descriptions of
structured, hierarchical data may have no interest in presenting their formats
as XML (may even resent the suggestion), but there are advantages to doing so:
the XML programming environment is a large one, populated with numerous
processors and applications. A bridge over other such data
formats—JSON, for a high-profile example—could provide that
format with the capabilities of the entire suite of XML tools (with the
reservation that there is apt to be an impedance mismatch of some degree, that
the bridge will attempt to minimize). This is most interesting when gXML is
used with the immutable paradigm; modifying these alternative structured
hierarchical data formats as well as analyzing them is a more difficult
problem and likely to have a higher degree of impedance mismatch.</textual></para><para class="po-block e472 e472"><textual class="po-textual">Again particularly with respect to immutable processing, gXML offers an

possibilities for enabling most-efficient processing, for enabling scripting

databases—has been slowed by the lack of support in dominant models,
and the limited extensibility possible. Even XML Schema has seen relatively
little adoption/development outside the enterprise; gXML includes a schema
model to address that issue. More importantly, the XQuery Data Model seems to
offer a well-thought foundation for the next ten years of development in
XML-related technologies. gXML proposes to embody that model for Java, while
