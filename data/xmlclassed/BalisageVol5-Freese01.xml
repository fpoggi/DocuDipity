In the past this meant warehouses of proof sheets.  As the publishing process became electronic, assets were archived on tape or disk in the event of a need to re-release (perhaps due to a popular subsequent movie or other event).  However, the challenge shifted from storage of materials to file compatibility and management of software versions.  Then along came XML, which offered a vendor-agnostic format in which to, at a minimum, archive data if not becoming the format in which the data was authored.  Now that publishers find themselves in the midst of an eBook boom they find themselves, yet again, dealing with managing different formats and, to complicate matters, dealing with different implementations of the same standard.  This paper will discuss the current state of the trade, textbook, and journal publishing industry as it pertains to creating eBooks for current and backlist resources.  It will also discuss the challenges faced by publishers as the technology continues to move forward toward “enhanced eBooks” at a pace faster than the standards can be updated.</textual></para><para class="po-block e8 e8"><textual class="po-textual">A sample project will be presented which presents the challenges of producing eBooks in the current environment as well as demonstrates how current standards might support the next generation of eBooks. </textual></para></abstract><author class="po-record e9 e9"><personname class="po-record e10 e10"><firstname class="po-field e11 e11"><textual class="po-textual">Eric</textual></firstname><surname class="po-field e12 e12"><textual class="po-textual">Freese</textual></surname></personname><personblurb class="po-container e13 e13"><para class="po-block e14 e14"><textual class="po-textual">Eric Freese is a veteran of publishing production optimization.

It is based on the Mobipocket standard, with a slightly different serial number scheme and its own Digital Rights Management (DRM) formatting. It is perhaps somewhat ironic that the Mobipocket e-book format is based on the OEBPS standard.  It uses XHTML and can include JavaScript and frames. It also supports native SQL queries to be used with embedded databases. Notably, Eastern European letters with diacritical marks and Pacific rim characters are not supported.

Adobe has addressed this by adding a re-flow facility to its Acrobat Reader software, but for this to work the document must be marked for re-flowing at creation, which means existing PDF documents will not benefit unless they are tagged and resaved.</textual></para></section></section><section class="po-hcontainer e62 e62"><title class="po-block e63 e63"><textual class="po-textual">Survey of Devices</textual></title><para class="po-block e64 e64"><textual class="po-textual">There are many different eBook reader devices available and seemingly more every day.  These devices can be divided into 2 basic classes.  The first is based on an E Ink electronic paper display.  These displays can currently only show shades of gray (although research is being done on color E Ink), are viewable in direct sunlight, and require no power to maintain a static image. There is no back lighting, which reduces eye strain, but makes them unreadable in the dark. The Amazon Kindle and Sony Reader are examples of this class of reader.  Many within this class of reader can play MP3 and other types of audio files. The second class uses backlit LCD screens and are often more than dedicated eBook reading devices.  For this project 8 devices were included in the test set.  These devices come from both classes and provide a mix of different features and capabilities.</textual></para><section class="po-hcontainer e65 e65"><title class="po-block e66 e66"><textual class="po-textual">Amazon Kindle</textual></title><para class="po-block e67 e67"><textual class="po-textual">Amazon Kindle is a software and hardware platform developed by Amazon.com for the rendering and displaying of e-books and other digital media. It was one of the first widely accepted eBook readers. The Kindle supports several ebook file formats including AZW/MOBI and PDF. The first version of the device was first sold in the U.S. in 2007.  The Kindle hardware device uses an E Ink brand electronic paper display that features 16 shades of gray and a six inch E Ink display. It downloads content over Amazon's Whispernet.  The Kindle hardware device is used without a computer connection, and Amazon Whispernet is accessible without any monthly fee or wireless subscription. Because the eBooks bought on the Kindle are delivered over its wireless system, the user does not see the AZW files during the download process.</textual></para><para class="po-block e68 e68"><textual class="po-textual">Kindle software applications exist for Windows, iOS, BlackBerry, Android and Mac OS X. This allows Kindle content to be read on devices running any of these operating systems. In software updates released in June 2010, capabilities were added to the Kindle software applications that are not supported by the Kindle device, most noteably the inclusion of audio and video. In doing so, Amazon created a requirement for graceful degradation within eBook files. Through a technology called "Whispersync," customers can connect reading progress, bookmarks, and other information across Kindle hardware devices and other mobile devices.</textual></para><para class="po-block e69 e69"><textual class="po-textual">Amazon's use of a proprietary format has allowed them to optimize the reader software to work extremely well with their data format.  The Kindle also has access to perhaps the largest online bookstore, as well as various independent sources and free content providers.  Also, for some time, Amazon was seen as the industry leader and therefore able to dictate to publishers what the prices on eBooks should be.

Each book, chapter and verse were also given IDs to provide anchor points for linking (e.g. footnote returns).  Since milestones do not occur consistently, it was decided to drop them and simply insert a marker indicating that a footnote is present.  In cases where quotes span over several paragraphs or chapters, the quotes are closed at the end of the larger structure and restarted in the preceding one.

In order to make navigation of the Bible file easier, it was suggested that hidden text be added at each book, chapter, and verse containing alternate search strings that would allow users to go directly to any anchor point.  This hidden text would also allow alternate spellings and abbreviations to be used, making navigation even more intuitive.  For example, a reference to Paul's second letter to Timothy, could be entered by a user as “2 Timothy”, "2nd Timothy”, “II Timothy”, “2 Tim”, “2nd Tim”, “II Tim”, etc.  These different variations are added to each anchor point in a &lt;span&gt; element with an class attribute set to “hidden”.  The CSS stylesheet then attempts to hide the text, while making it searchable.  Our Luke example with the hidden text is shown below.

For example, the devices that support the Adobe DRM can interchange eBooks between them, but have different capabilities.

Most audio and video formats are already compressed, so therefore they do not compress significantly inside the EPUB file.  This requires memory overhead to open the files inside the readers.  It also requires longer download times for the books when they are first loaded onto the eBook reader.</textual></para><para class="po-block e174 e174"><textual class="po-textual">Referencing files produces smaller EPUB files, but requires a mechanism (usually a web browser) to retrieve and present the resources.  This requires that the eBook reader be online.  There will also be a lag between the time the link is selected and the resource is downloaded.  This is especially noticeable with large video files.</textual></para></section></section><section class="po-hcontainer e175 e175"><title class="po-block e176 e176"><textual class="po-textual">Future work</textual></title><para class="po-block e177 e177"><textual class="po-textual">Once the base functionality has been implemented and tested on all the devices, some possible additions have already been considered.  This work will be used to test possible updates to the EPUB standard being considered now.  We would like to include inter eBook reference which allow the reader to start in one eBook and open another.  This would be useful in this context for reference materials such as concordances, dictionaries, topical indexes, biblical names lists, etc.</textual></para><para class="po-block e178 e178"><textual class="po-textual">Of course an app may be considered as the ultimate enhanced eBook.  It has not been decided at this point whether an app will be attempted and on which platform.  It would probably be either iPad or Android.</textual></para></section><section class="po-hcontainer e179 e179"><title class="po-block e180 e180"><textual class="po-textual">Conclusion</textual></title><para class="po-block e181 e181"><textual class="po-textual">The work done on this project demonstrated the strengths and weaknesses of the different reading devices and evaluated different strategies for working around any weaknesses.  It also highlighted the various ways in which the implementation of the same standard can lead to inconsistent results, which brings into question the effectiveness of the standard in the first place.  In a market that is new and largely consumer oriented, these inconsistencies can only increase confusion. It would seem imperative that the industry work on methods to reduce the perceived inconsistency without limiting innovation or reducing competition.</textual></para></section></article></classedDocument>
