        sciences journal literature. On average the PMC team processes 14,000 articles per month.
        All of the articles are submitted to the archive by publishers in an agreed-upon markup
        format, and the articles are transformed to a common article model. To help reduce the
        number of content- or markup-related problems encountered, PMC puts new participating
        journals through an evaluation period that includes both automated and manual checks. </textual></para><para class="po-block e8 e8"><textual class="po-textual">Once a journal has passed the evaluation stage, it sends its content to PMC on a regular
        production schedule. The production content is processed automatically when it arrives, with
        any processing problems generating expected error messages. Although most of the content
        sent to PMC has been through production systems and QA when it was published, we've found
        that there is still a level of manual content checking that needs to be done on the
        production content. Any problems found must be investigated to determine if they result from
        a problem in the source content, a problem with the PMC ingest transforms, or simply a
        problem with our rendering of the normalized XML content. </textual></para><para class="po-block e9 e9"><textual class="po-textual">Having the content in XML certainly has advantages: it can be validated against a schema

        publishing process. </textual></para></abstract><author class="po-record e10 e10"><personname class="po-record e11 e11"><firstname class="po-field e12 e12"><textual class="po-textual">Christopher</textual></firstname><surname class="po-field e13 e13"><textual class="po-textual">Kelly</textual></surname></personname><personblurb class="po-container e14 e14"><para class="po-block e15 e15"><textual class="po-textual">Ciao Pippo!

      they are processed and loaded to the PMC database. The number of articles in each batch is
      determined by the publication model and participation mode of the journal itself. Traditional
      journals which deposit a whole issue at a time into PMC will normally have a "batch"
      consisting of all the articles in the issue. Journals which publishing on a continuous basis
      and send content to PMC article-by-article will have batches which reflect how much content is

      database, this is generally not reasonable because of resources. So, once an journal has
      passed the tightly monitored data evaluation period, and has demonstrated over a period of
      time after moving into production that it can provide generally error-free data, QA is done on
      more of a spot check basis. By default, new journals that come out of data evaluation and move
      into production are set with a higher threshold of articles selected for QA in the system.
      Once PMC's Journal Manager is confident in the journal's ability to provide good, clean, data,
      the article-selection percentages are lowered over time. Journals with a proven track record
      of providing error-free data into PMC generally have lower percentage of articles checked for
      QA. If the Journal Manager begins to see problems on an ongoing basis, the percentage of
      articles checked may be increased.</textual><figure class="po-container e136 e136" xml:id="F2" xreflabel="Fig. 2"><title class="po-block e137 e137"><textual class="po-textual">QA System Dashboard</textual></title><mediaobject class="po-container e138 e138"><imageobject class="po-container e139 e139"><imagedata class="po-meta e140 e140" fileref="../../../vol9/graphics/Beck01/Beck01-002.jpg" format="jpg"><textual class="po-textual">Ciao Pippo!
