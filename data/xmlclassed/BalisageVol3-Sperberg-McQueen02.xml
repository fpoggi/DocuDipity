I take a certain pleasure now in recollecting that one of the problems Charles
Babbage struggled with for a long time was to improve the behavior and
performance of his mechanisms for carrying digits from one column to another, 
because of course one carry could lead to another carry, could lead to another 
carry. And making that happen fast was a serious problem for Babbage.
It gives me particular pleasure to recollect that, because Rob Cameron 
has observed that his team have been able to simplify and refine their 
technique to the point where the entire technique revolves around this one 
problem of making a carry bit go from one context to another when needed:  
everything can be reduced to that one problem. It’s nice how much continuity

professional programmers as random guesswork, to find the bottleneck. And

us on the user side of the keyboard are not powerless; with application and 
determination and a little luck we can help ourselves to better performance, 
even if we can’t get much help from the developers.  Work on scalability is

system changes scale dramatically, the character of the problem changes, 
and we often need new algorithms.  So if you look at textbooks published in 
the 1980s, their description of sorting doesn’t look like the same thing as the 
descriptions of sorting published in textbooks in the 1970s. Why? Because 
the kinds of things people needed to sort had changed — or rather, 
the kinds of things people needed to sort were much the same, but the 
underlying hardware was so different that you could have an entirely new set 
of algorithms that performed much better. Over time it can happen that the 
other factors in the system catch up, and the system regains something like 
its original overall proportions, the problem changes again, and we may find 
that techniques developed in the 1970s for program inversion are practially 
relevant again. Knuth’s discussion of tape sorting has never lost its purely 
mathematical interest and beauty.  But nowadays, programmers may be reading 
it not for the sake of its mathematical beauty but to help them optimize current 
systems, which aren’t using tapes but are using storage which, like tapes, is 
slower than core.  (Do I date myself if I call it </textual><quote class="po-inline e55 e55"><textual class="po-textual">core</textual></quote><textual class="po-textual">? I guess I

modern Web browsers are dramatically simpler than Guide, but the initial 
ones certainly were); and it encourages low expectations on the part of the
