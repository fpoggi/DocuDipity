      be answered. Even the participants of this very special conference have sometimes problems to
      find the correct answer. An some of the younger generation have never heard terms like
      'sosofo' or 'DSSSL' before. At current, an unmanageable number of standards is available for
      annotating data of various kinds. These standards can be divided into several groups,
      according to such different features such as standard body (W3C, ISO, OASIS, HL7, to name just
      a few), basic or derivative work (i. e., standards that are built upon basic specifications),
      the state (de jure vs. de facto standard), or the topic. </textual><xref class="po-milestone e47 e47" linkend="fig1"><textual class="po-textual">Ciao Pippo! Ciao Pippo! Ciao Pippo! Ciao Pippo!

      rough overview about some of the named aspects. Other divisions would deal with a temporal

      historical standards have been abandoned and have been replaced by other
      specifications.</textual></para><figure class="po-container e48 e48" xml:id="fig1"><title class="po-block e49 e49"><textual class="po-textual">A rough overview about the complexity in the fields of standardization.</textual></title><mediaobject class="po-container e50 e50"><imageobject class="po-container e51 e51"><imagedata class="po-meta e52 e52" fileref="../../../vol8/graphics/Stuhrenberg01/Stuhrenberg01-001.png" format="png"><textual class="po-textual">Ciao Pippo!

      between different standards. For example, meta languages such as SGML or XML are used to
      define (that is, syntax and possibly a schema formalism) markup languages. A given markup
      language is defined by a schema which in turn is defined by using a schema language (either a
      grammar-based or rule-based constraint language), and so on. Apart from these relations
      between basic standards and those that are built upon these, are other relations between
      members of the first group and of the second group. Some of the formal restrictions of XML
      instances and XML DTDs (and even XSD) are based on faits accomplis created during the
      development of SGML, DSSSL and HyTime &amp;#8211; standards that are decades old. Features
      that were already present in DSSSL, have been improved and adapted for current W3C standards
      such as XPath, XSLT and XSL-FO. XPath is usually used via a host language such as XSLT. The
      Corpus Encoding Standard (CES) is an application of the SGML-based version of the TEI, P3. The
      are dozens of similar relations, some are only good for get bonus points at Balisage Bingo but
      others really help in understanding specific issues one may have when working with a given
      specification. At least the knowledge about these older standards and the decisions that were
      made during their design process and which still impact current technologies such as XML
      schema or XSLT runs the risk of being forgotten just because of the amount of time already
      passed.</textual></para><para class="po-block e54 e54"><textual class="po-textual">This holds especially when dealing with non-basic standards, for example with markup
      languages for annotating linguistic data. During the last couple of years a large number of
      specifications have been developed in ISO/IEC TC 37/SC 4 Language Resources Management. These
      standards are often released to the public during their various stages of the standardization
      process (either as publicly available specialisations, such as Draft International Standard or
      as topic of a research paper). However, these version may substantially differ from the final
      version of the standard which is usually not available without charge. In addition, the
      relations between these specifications are numerous which complicates their correct
      use.</textual></para><para class="po-block e55 e55"><textual class="po-textual">Another problem is the fact, that often scholars and researchers are not even aware that
