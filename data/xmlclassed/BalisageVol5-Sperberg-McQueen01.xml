Like most folktales, the story of </textual><emphasis class="po-inline e25 e25"><textual class="po-textual">Stone Soup</textual></emphasis><textual class="po-textual">
circulates in a variety of forms.  Some of you will have heard it in
one form, some in another; some of you may never have heard it or not
recognize it under this name.  For those of you keeping score at home,
you will want to know this is number 1548 in the Aarne-Thompson system

It's the end of a long war.  Three destitute soldiers are making their
way through a war-ravaged landscape, trying to get home, struggling
against hunger and fatigue and suspicious villagers.  They are
benighted in a remote place, and they find a village as it is getting
late afternoon or early evening, and they knock on a door and ask for
food.  The master of the house tells them, </textual><quote class="po-inline e27 e27"><textual class="po-textual">No, we don't have enough
food to share with anybody,</textual></quote><textual class="po-textual"> and slams the door in their faces.

They go to the next house, same story.  They go through all the houses
in the village; no one has enough food to be willing to share with
strangers.  So they go to the central place of the village, and they
pull out a pot, and they go out to the nearby forest, and they gather
some wood, and they make a fire.  And one of them comes in, bringing a
large stone, and he puts it in the pot.  And they go out to the
stream, and they draw water, and they fill the pot with water, and
they start making the motions of cooking.

chives, maybe some carrots, some meal — some oatmeal or flour — to
thicken, potatoes, eventually some beef, and by the end of the, by the

soup together and having a wonderful evening because when they share,
they do have enough.

Now, it seems to me that this story of stone soup may illuminate our
situation possibly in more than one way.  Most obviously, of course,
it describes a situation of limited resources, of reduced
circumstances which may feel familiar to a lot of people from the last
couple of years, given the situation of the world economy and the
national economies of the various countries where most of us live.
All of you will be aware that there are lot of people who are feeling
rather straitened in their circumstances and wondering how to make do
with less.
</textual></para><para class="po-block e44 e44"><textual class="po-textual">
Of course, making do with less, lowering resource consumption,
re-using existing resources — that, of course, has been a
standard injunction to system designers and implementors for years.
</textual><quote class="po-inline e45 e45"><textual class="po-textual">Don't re-invent the wheel!  Don't waste resources by unnecessary
duplication.  Re-use.  Share.</textual></quote><textual class="po-textual">

If there is anyone who ought to feel comfortable in a world of acute
attention to careful use of resources, it ought to be people using
descriptive markup.  The principle of thrift that is embedded in the
idea of re-use, the principle of openness embedded in the idea of
information sharing, were, after all, the original motives for the
development of descriptive markup in the first place as embodied in
SGML and later in XML and still later in experimental languages like
TexMecs and LMNL and Freestyle Markup Language and so forth.  </textual><emphasis class="po-inline e47 e47"><textual class="po-textual">Stone soup</textual></emphasis><textual class="po-textual"> could almost be the official folktale of

Now, of course, a lot of things change.  But as Eric Freese showed us
on the first day [</textual><xref class="po-milestone e49 e49" linkend="Freese"><textual class="po-textual">Ciao Pippo! Ciao Pippo! Ciao Pippo! Ciao Pippo! Ciao Pippo! Ciao Pippo! Ciao Pippo! Ciao Pippo! Ciao</textual></xref><textual class="po-textual">], the idea of
re-use — of sharing — in the form of single-source
publishing to multiple targets is still alive and well and living
today on mobile devices.</textual></para><para class="po-block e50 e50"><textual class="po-textual">
But, of course, you don't always have the markup that you would like.
In Eric's case, the main problem was he had markup that captured
information he wasn't interested in so his first problem was to clear
out markup he had no use for.  Frequently, of course, we have too
little information or the wrong kind of information.  Or the title of
the video game has been replaced by a digital image, and you have no
textual access to it.

Intelligent use of what you have has always been part of the story of
descriptive markup.  One of my favorite histories in this regard took

The Perseus Project sent these offshore to be keyboarded, and of
course, the keyboardists were not classical philologists, so they were
keying in what were to them opaque strings.  And the most you can
expect in a situation like that is a fairly careful typographic
markup.  So they get digitized texts of the dictionaries back, but,
you know, what you have marked is </textual><quote class="po-inline e63 e63"><textual class="po-textual">font shifts</textual></quote><textual class="po-textual"> and </textual><quote class="po-inline e64 e64"><textual class="po-textual">bold</textual></quote><textual class="po-textual">

front of us before this can be a really useful digital resource.</textual></quote><textual class="po-textual">
But, of course, the Perseus Project is not limited to short-term
results.  They've been around for awhile.  They expect to be around
awhile, and they are, of course, dealing with data whose average age
is a little more than 2,000 years, so they're not impatient people.
So, the first thing they did was make a stylesheet so they could
display dictionary entries in their browser.  Entry boundaries were,
of course, marked in the data they had so that was fairly easy; you
could look up a word and look at the dictionary entry. 
</textual></para><para class="po-block e69 e69"><textual class="po-textual">
Now, Greg Crane was from an early age known a regex wizard (he's a
fanatical user of lex — not yacc, just lex). He noticed, </textual><quote class="po-inline e70 e70"><textual class="po-textual">You
know, there's an interesting thing here. Arabic numerals occur in
exactly two positions in an average article in Greek-English
dictionaries.   It is either the book and section number of a citation
and is immediately followed by Greek characters, or it's a sense
number in which case it's immediately followed by a Latin character
because glosses are given in English.</textual></quote><textual class="po-textual">  And armed with this
information — most of you could write the appropriate regular
expression already — armed with this information, he was able to
identify the major sense boundaries in the articles of the dictionary.
And as he pointed out, it was at that moment — six weeks after
they got the digitized data, not six years — that the digital
object became more useful for almost every purpose than the paper
object because they could insert blank lines between the senses and it
became much easier to get an overview of long and complicated
articles.  If you have ever studied dead languages with dictionaries
built by philologists whose attention to detail is, shall we say,
fabled in the academic world, you know that a long dictionary entry
may go on for column after column after column and because space is at
a premium on the page, there is no typographic marking.  You have to
pay attention to the numbers.  But because space is not at such a
premium on the screen — pixels are free in ways that paper is
not — they were able to make it visually easier to track the
structure of articles.  And at that point, almost everybody in the
Perseus Project preferred to look up words in the electronic version
rather than the paper version because it was easier to use.

One of the reasons I liked the paper by Stefanie Haupt and Maik
Stührenberg the other day is that it illustrates the same kind of
thing [</textual><xref class="po-milestone e72 e72" linkend="Haupt"><textual class="po-textual">Ciao Pippo! Ciao Pippo! Ciao Pippo! Ciao Pippo! Ciao Pippo! Ciao Pippo! Ciao Pippo! Ciao Pippo! Ciao</textual></xref><textual class="po-textual">].  
It has always been a challenge to find ways to do
up-translation, but the key remains the same:  Know your data; exploit
that knowledge.  Knowing that even if the title on the main review has
been replaced by an image, you can probably find it by following a
link and then looking for the back link, that requires knowledge of
data.  Exploiting that knowledge makes possible an up-translation that
might otherwise have looked impossible.  Know your data.

Economic poverty comes in at least two different forms.  Some people
are poor because they have no choice.  But in many cultures, there are
those who embrace economic poverty willingly, often for religious or,
more generally, spiritual reasons.  Here in primarily Catholic Quebec,
monasticism comes to mind.  Intellectually there seems to be an
analogous kind of choice or move made by those who focus their
attention on a small number of fundamental objects or questions.  And
one of the big themes for me of this year's Balisage has definitely
been the very prominent thread of focus on fundamentals and on
foundations in two rather different flavors; first, there are
foundational questions and foundational, intellectual topics.  I think
here of Mario Mario Blažević's work exploiting the

Of course, one of the other intellectual foundational questions that
has always occupied this conference and its predecessors — the
problem of overlap — was also well-represented this year.  Piotr

help to keep that thread of Balisage papers alive.

But most visible in this area of fundamental concepts, I think, are
the various papers on this and that aspect of semantics.  The work by
Quinn and Andrew Dombrowski in the pre-conference's symposium applying
Montague semantics to the question of vocabulary choice for
institutions that aim at long-term preservation of 
data [</textual><xref class="po-milestone e80 e80" linkend="Dombrowski"><textual class="po-textual">Ciao Pippo! Ciao Pippo! Ciao Pippo! Ciao Pippo! Ciao Pippo! Ciao Pippo! Ciao Pippo! Ciao Pippo! Ciao</textual></xref><textual class="po-textual">].

But there's another kind of foundation that's been, I think, more
visible than usual at this year's Balisage.  If you wanted to redo the
foundations of a lot of our work, you would have to spend time
improving the situation of XML processing in our programming language
libraries and improving the tools that we use to build applications
for our customers, so you might want to have, say, somebody smart
working on a better API to tree representations so that you weren't
locked in to this or that tree model the moment you wrote an XML
application.  So you might want exactly what Amelia Lewis and Eric

gXML [</textual><xref class="po-milestone e90 e90" linkend="Lewis"><textual class="po-textual">Ciao Pippo! Ciao Pippo! Ciao Pippo! Ciao Pippo! Ciao Pippo! Ciao Pippo! Ciao Pippo! Ciao Pippo! Ciao</textual></xref><textual class="po-textual">].

possible in the browser, so you would want surely an XProc processor

The second aspect of the stone soup story that strikes me though, one
is that the soup is like an agile product; it goes through a number of
iterations.  And the first one really doesn't have a very close
resemblance to the last; it starts out as hot water, and it ends up as
soup or stew.  And the idea of getting something done — getting
something out — and iterating again and again and again as many
times as it takes is also one that is useful to take to heart.  It

Early Unix and C are examples of the use of this school of design, and

C is a
programming language designed for writing Unix, and it was designed
using the New Jersey approach. C is therefore a language for which it
is easy to write a decent compiler, and it requires the programmer to
write text that is easy for the compiler to interpret. Some have
called C a fancy assembly language. Both early Unix and C compilers
had simple structures, are easy to port, require few machine resources
to run, and provide about 50%-80% of what you want from an operating
system and programming language.

Half the computers that exist at any point are worse than median
(smaller or slower). Unix and C work fine on them. The worse-is-better
philosophy means that implementation simplicity has highest priority,
which means Unix and C are easy to port on such machines. Therefore,
one expects that if the 50% functionality Unix and C support is
satisfactory, they will start to appear everywhere. And they have,
haven't they?</textual><footnote class="po-popup e132 e132"><para class="po-block e133 e133"><textual class="po-textual">Remember, this is 1991.  -CMSMcQ</textual></para></footnote><textual class="po-textual">

A further benefit of the worse-is-better philosophy is that the
programmer is conditioned to sacrifice some safety, convenience, and
hassle to get good performance and modest resource use. Programs
written using the New Jersey approach will work well both in small
machines and large ones, and the code will be portable because it is
written on top of a virus.
</textual></para><para class="po-block e136 e136"><textual class="po-textual">
It is important to remember that the initial virus has to be basically
good. If so, the viral spread is assured as long as it is
portable. Once the virus has spread, there will be pressure to improve
it, possibly by increasing its functionality closer to 90%, but users
have already been conditioned to accept worse than the right
thing. Therefore, the worse-is-better software first will gain
acceptance, second will condition its users to expect less, and third
will be improved to a point that is almost the right thing. In
concrete terms, even though Lisp compilers in 1987 were about as good
as C compilers, there are many more compiler experts who want to make
C compilers better than want to make Lisp compilers better.

If the XSLT 1.0 working group had
tried to put those features into 1.0, we would still be waiting for

The third lesson I draw from the stone soup story took me a little bit
by surprise because I didn't see it for a long time, but the final
product, the soup that everyone enjoys, is not created by the three
soldiers and not by the villagers working alone or individually, but
by everyone working together.  The stone doesn't create it either; it
catalyzes it, together with the story told by the soldiers.  There is
an object lesson there perhaps in the catalytic effects of the right
narrative, but also an object lesson in the importance of the social
context.  Working collaboratively is difficult.  But there are
advantages we can achieve, if we manage to overcome our aversion to
the risks inherent in collaboration and to the risks involved in

So the story of stone soup seems to me to illustrate three lessons we
can usefully keep in mind.  Make the most of what you have.  Second,
iterate. Start simple and then keep trying; don't let the best be the
enemy of the good. But also and contrarily — this is the way
proverbs always are — prepare for future growth; prepare for
change.  Try to avoid getting locked into a particular technology or
version of your technology forever for backward compatibility reasons,
i.e., don't let the good be the enemy of the best.  Work for a path
where you can get the good now and get the best, or at least better,
later.  Third, work together.  The kind of information we want to
collect, manage, and preserve is for the most part social,
organizational, and cultural information.  Even when it's purely
scientific data, even when it's the mass spectrometer data, the reason
that we want it and the way that we exploit it are given partly by our
cultural organizations.  It arises from and has meaning primarily, or
exclusively in some cases, in the social context; don't leave that
social context out of account.
</textual></para><para class="po-block e181 e181"><textual class="po-textual">
One way to make the most of what you have, of course, is to learn by
talking to other people and by attending conferences like, for
instance, Balisage.  One way to iterate is to do so on a schedule, to
do things again and again at regular intervals like, for example,
annually, like Balisage.  One way to remember the social context is to
remember that you are part of it and to make yourself actively a part
of it, for example, by gathering together with people with whom you
share interests, for example, at Balisage.  So, one moral of the stone
soup story is attend Balisage in Montreal!  Of course, you already
knew that.  Some of the best stories remind us of things we already
know.  Now, on Monday or Tuesday I remember standing up here and
saying how glad I was to see so many unfamiliar faces in the audience,
and I'm equally happy today to see how many of those faces have become
familiar, now representing friends I hope to see at future occurrences
of this conference.  Some of them I haven't managed to talk to as much
as I would like, which just means you also have to come back next year
so we can try again.  Thank you for coming to Balisage, and I hope to
see you next year and in years future at Balisage.
