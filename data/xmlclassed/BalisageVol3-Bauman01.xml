                    representations of real-world conceptualizations. These languages are sometimes
                    named domain modeling languages (e.g., LINGO), ontology representation languages
                    (e.g., OWL), semantic data modeling languages (e.g., ER), among other terms. ...
                    Although these languages are employed in practice for conceptual modeling, they
                    are not designed with the specific purpose of being truthful to reality. For
                    instance, LINGO (Falbo &amp; Menezes &amp; Rocha, 1998; Falbo &amp; Guizzardi
                    &amp; Duarte, 2002) was designed with the specific objective of achieving a
                    positive trade-off between expression power of the language and the ability to
                    facilitate bridging the gap between the conceptual and implementation levels.
                    This preoccupation also seems to be present in Peter Chen's original proposal
                    for ER diagrams (Chen, 1976). OWL (Horrocks &amp; Patel-Schneider &amp; van
                    Harmelen, 2003) has been designed with the main purpose of achieving
                    computational efficiency in an automatic reasoning process. Some other
                    languages, such as Z (Spivey, 1988) and CC Technique (Dijkman &amp; Ferreira
                    Pires &amp; Joosten, 2001), take advantage of the simplicity of the well-defined
                    mathematical framework of set theory. Finally, some of the languages used
                    nowadays for conceptual modeling were created for different purposes, the most
                    notorious example being the UML (OMG, 2003c), which initially focused on
                    software design.</textual></para></blockquote><textual class="po-textual">Designs reflect hard engineering trade-offs, starting with the initial
            choice of an implementation language which will have only limited abilities to express
            the full richness of the UoD, and ending with the numerous design choices made (e.g.,
            denormalization, implementing relationships, by reference, vs. by value, collapsing
            generalization hierarchies). This intertwining of implementation design and semantics
            with semantics taking a back seat, means that no formal model representing just the
            semantics remains. The sole guardian of pure semantics is the informal prose, in the

            on words is their ambiguity. Although formally the interplay of words with meaning is

            drawbacks. The first, is that ultimately for two or more systems to interoperate they
            must share a compatible understanding of the UoD, they needn't necessarily share the
            same design. This task of determining, and ultimately documenting via a mapping,
            compatibility, or recognizing when and where it is not possible is made more difficult.
            Second, when people negotiate to decide on a common language for sharing information,
            the discussion can / will often stray between discussing differences in meaning, and
            differences in design. Its helpful in resolving disagreements to know which of the two
            classes of discussion one is having. Third, it is perfectly reasonable, desirable, and
            necessary to implement the same UoD in multiple implementation languages and/or in
            multiple designs. Capturing explicitly a model of the UoD allows it to be reused. This
            is even more beneficial if the domain is highly complex and/or technical and modeling it

                modeling languages like UML and ERD. As another example an anti-rigid type cannot be
                a supertype to a rigid type. These rules together create restrictions on how
                concepts can be related to each other, reducing the likelihood that skilled modelers
                will produce unsound models, and increasing the likelihood that they will use model
                constructs in similar ways (i.e. construct variability will be reduced). These

                    The root is always the name of the concept. The prefix depends on what type of
