                philosophy of documents as trees (as dictated by meta-markup languages such as SGML
                and XML) is a simplification that sometimes fails and requires corrections. These
                corrections have been proposed at the markup level (e.g., milestones, segmentation),
                at the meta-markup level (e.g., LMNL, TexMecs, XCONCUR, etc.) or at level of the
                abstract model (e.g., GODDAG). Unfortunately full GODDAGs do not allow
                linearizations in general, and as such a restricted version of GODDAG, r-GODDAG, has
                been proposed that is guaranteed to be linearizable (in TexMecs) and still allows
                many nice features beyond trees.</textual></para><para class="po-block e8 e8"><textual class="po-textual">In this paper we discuss that the problem of linearizing more-than-hierarchical
                structures lies basically in the embedding of markup within content and that no such
                problem arises with an appropriate standoff approach, that is able to represent full
                GODDAGs without restrictions. This gives ample opportunities to deal with
                interesting markup features that are describable with GODDAGs but not with
                r-GODDAGs, such as non-contiguous elements and virtual elements.</textual></para><para class="po-block e9 e9"><textual class="po-textual">Besides, we discuss whether a specific constraint of full GODDAGs is really
                necessary once all residual hopes of embeddability are given up, and we further
                propose a minimal extension to GODDAG, genially called "extended GODDAG" (e-GODDAG)
                that, by removing the requirement for names in non-terminal nodes, adds support for
                additional interesting markup features such as content repetitions. In truth,
                e-GODDAGs are even less embeddable than full GODDAGs, but they are just as easily
                dealt with by using stand-off markup.</textual></para><para class="po-block e10 e10"><textual class="po-textual">We further propose a meta-syntax for non-embedded markup, called EARMARK, that can
                be used for stand-off annotations of textual content, and that naturally represents
                e-GODDAGs with fully W3C-compliant technologies. EARMARK is based on an
                ontologically precise definition of markup that instantiates the markup of a text
                document as an OWL document, and through appropriate OWL and SWRL characterizations
                it can define structures such as trees, r-GODDAGs, full GODDAGs and e-GODDAGs, and
                can be used to generate validity constraints (including co-constraints), and to
                verify adherence to content model patterns.</textual></para><para class="po-block e11 e11"><textual class="po-textual">As mentioned, in general the embedding of a full EARMARK document is not straightforward,
                but approaches can be taken in that direction: just like segmentation and
                fragmentation are strategies to embed in a strictly-hierarchical language a
                r-GODDAG-specific feature such as overlapping elements, similarly a number of
                strategies exist to provide embedding of GODDAG and e-GODDAG features in less
                expressive syntaxes. In the final part of the paper we discuss our wish to provide
                at the metalanguage level a series of embedding strategies of the non-hierarchical
                features of EARMARK, i.e. a number of language-independent mechanisms to express
                e-GODDAGs structures into XML (as well as in TexMecs and in LMNL) and that can be
                recognized as such (i.e., as strategies, as tricks) by tools and readers alike,
                especially for further uses of such documents.</textual></para></abstract><author class="po-record e12 e12"><personname class="po-record e13 e13"><firstname class="po-field e14 e14"><textual class="po-textual">Angelo</textual></firstname><surname class="po-field e15 e15"><textual class="po-textual">Di Iorio</textual></surname></personname><personblurb class="po-container e16 e16"><para class="po-block e17 e17"><textual class="po-textual">Angelo Di Iorio holds a Ph.D. in Computer Science, from the University of

            language-dependent markup structures devoted to supporting overlapping. Some of such
            solutions, such as milestones and fragmentation, are so general and widely applicable
            that have been proposed even outside of the specificity of just one markup language
            (e.g., see </textual><xref class="po-milestone e46 e46" linkend="bib-20"><textual class="po-textual">Ciao Pippo! Ciao Pippo! Ciao Pippo! Ciao Pippo! Ciao Pippo! Ciao Pippo! Ciao Pippo!

            XML languages. Further approaches have been to create new meta-markup languages,
            inspired by but independent from XML such as TexMecs, LMNL, XCONCUR, that provide at the
            metalanguage itself support for more than a single hierarchy. This makes it possible for
            any language defined within the syntax to make use of the features for overlaps, without
            the need for further special tools to make sense of the annotations. </textual></para><para class="po-block e47 e47"><textual class="po-textual">At the conceptual level, what has shown its limits is the idea of forcing tree-like

            GODDAGs do not allow an immediate linearization in form of an XML-like syntax (even if
            extended in some way), but a variant, restricted GODDAGs (</textual><xref class="po-milestone e49 e49" linkend="bib-5"><textual class="po-textual">Ciao Pippo! Ciao Pippo! Ciao Pippo!

            though, the linearization of full generalized GODDAGs does not allow to keep all information
            expressed in the original graph. Many additional useful features of
            GODDAGs (e.g., virtual elements) can only be converted in XML structures by recurring to 
            procedural tricks. </textual></para><para class="po-block e51 e51"><textual class="po-textual">In this paper we discuss whether the problem of generalized GODDAGs lies in the

            Furthermore, we propose a minimal extension to GODDAGs to provide full support of
            repeated content in GODDAGs (currently only allowed if appearing in different

            relevant here is the process of embedding EARMARK documents in traditional embedded
            languages, such as XML or TexMecs. Of course, not all EARMARK assertions can be directly
            transformed into XML markup structures. The specific subset of the EARMARK document that
            can be expressed in the destination syntax (e.g., any of the possible tree substructures
            for XML, or of the r-GODDAG substructures for TexMecs) can be directly generated, and
            the remaining ones need to be either left out or forcedly embedded using any of a number
            of well-known or newly-introduced syntactic tricks (up to, of course, leaving part of

            RDF annotations do not change the annotated resource in any way, but refer to it via
            URIs. The problem we face in this case is that there exists no URI referring to a
            fragment of text that is not wrapped within an XML or XHTML element provided with an ID.
            And since XHTML or XML elements need to follow a nice, hierarchical,

                e-GODDAGs. Consider the case of unordered items. Although e-GODDAGs always considers
                ordered markup items and ranges within a container, EARMARK allows us to specify
                whether the items are ordered or not, by simply using “rdf:Seq” and “rdf:Bag”
                container classes. The ordering of inner elements becomes a matter of explicit
                choice rather than implicitly given by the markup embedding.</textual></para><para class="po-block e498 e498"><textual class="po-textual">Consequently, EARMARK even allows us to specify sequences of attributes, elements
                and ranges in any arbitrary order. Differently than XML, LMNL and TexMECS, EARMARK
                makes possible sequences in which attributes, elements and ranges are freely mixed
                in any order, including elements followed by attributes followed by other elements
                and so on. Moreover, the same global identifier can be specified for multiple
                attributes in the sequence (i.e., EARMARK allows multiple attributes with the same
                name for the same element). These situations are not directly expressible in any embedded

            for expressing GODDAGs (and e-GODDAG) structures in a general metamarkup language that
            does not rely on embedding, and that integrates the advantages of standoff annotations
            and embedded markup into a single unifying framework. </textual></para><para class="po-block e599 e599"><textual class="po-textual">Through EARMARK authors can express a large number of markup assertions and
            observations that would otherwise be non expressible, including overlapping elements,
            elements over non contiguous ranges, repeated structures, text variants, overlapping
            hierarchies, structured attributes, etc.</textual></para><para class="po-block e600 e600"><textual class="po-textual">In further work we plan both to explore the application of the structural patterns

            The anonymous reviewers of this and other EARMARK papers were incredibly useful in smoothing
            out both the basic concepts and the written explanation of the most oscure parts of the proposal. 
            The participants to the Goddag Workshop in Amsterdam (December 2008) have in no small part 
            provided thought fodder for what ended up becoming EARMARK. Finally, we wish to thank explicitly 
            Michael Sperberg-McQueen and Federico Meschini for their help, comments and suggestions.</textual></para></section><bibliography class="po-hcontainer e605 e605"><title class="po-block e606 e606"><textual class="po-textual">Bibliography</textual></title><bibliomixed class="po-block e607 e607" xml:id="bib-21" xreflabel="[1]"><textual class="po-textual">Adida, B., Birbeck, M., McCarron, S.,
