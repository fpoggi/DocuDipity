      The goal of this paper is to put forward some ideas in a broader
      forum and elicit feedback and alternative perspectives. It is
      possible that these ideas have already been discussed elsewhere,
      and we are simply not aware of any consensus previously reached
      regarding them. Hopefully, this paper will help to clarify some
      of these issues and lead towards practical solutions.

        Context is one of those concepts that most people feel is
        essential to understanding something, but which sparks great

        rather than deal with the complexity of the perceptions and
        assumptions involved in how the participants view a given
        interaction. In order to achieve this, it is necessary to

      a truly objective observer attempting to capture an objective
      context would establish each of the "who", "what", "where",
      "when" and "how", but would be unable to capture any meaningful
      understanding of the "why" beyond any surface remarks made
      during the meeting, e.g. "We are here today to finalize the
      implementation plan for Project X". While this may make any
      given context more easily suited to use by autonomous agents and
      deductive reasoning, it may not accurately reflect the complete

        It would therefore seem that the subjective interpretation

        understanding and knowledge about a particular domain. They
        are ultimately created by humans - whether directly authored

        people - and therefore reflect a subjective view of that
        domain shaped by the implicit factors inherent in any form of
        communication. This means that they will be vulnerable to many
        contextual ambiguities "born out of a misplaced belief on the

        This vulnerability is potentially problematic because of the

        unlike a document or other work created with a particular
        intention and with assumptions about context shared between
        author and readership, information in a specific topic map can
        find itself far outside the context the original author had in

        lost. Since context is so critical to effective communication,

        It may well be that there are two, arguably conflicting, views
        on the role of topic maps. Is a specific topic map intended as
        something to be studied for greater understanding of a given
        domain, or is it intended to capture a body of information to
        support ad-hoc queries to answer questions about a
        domain—limited only to the information at hand? How this
        question is answered may have significant implications for the
        type of information and manner used in expressing context

        In the first case, the goal is to engage users so that they
        become active participants in the topic map. In this case, the
        information in the specific topic map would act similarly to
        the text in Paul Auster's literature and become "'a

Ciao Pippo! Ciao Pippo! Ciao Pippo! Ciao</textual></xref><textual class="po-textual">]. The intended use for the topic map is to help the user
        understand something new about the topic map's domain. Knowing
        as much as possible about the domain-view of those capturing
        the information and relationships - including the ontology -
        of the topic map will greatly enhance the process of
        cross-domain information sharing. In this respect, support

        level of contextual information captured may not need to be as
        great, as indicated above. Its goal is not to support deep

        One of the differences between scope in Topic Maps and infons

        relationship and a polarity. In this way, they define a
        context (situation) that can be used as a primitive object to
        determine relevance of other relationships and situations
        within the system. While a similar notion could possibly be
        expressed as a Topic Map query, this construct does not seem
        sufficiently rich with which to represent context within a
