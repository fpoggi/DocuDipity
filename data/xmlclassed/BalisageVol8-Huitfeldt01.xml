            Roughly, and limiting ourselves to modern Western culture, literary and musical works
            are based on notations and are therefore allographic, whereas sculptures and paintings
            are non-notational, and therefore autographic. No copy of Mona Lisa or replica of David
            is an authentic manifestation of Mona Lisa or David, whereas any edition of Hamlet or
            performance of Bolero is a manifestation of Hamlet and Bolero, respectively. In the
            former case, the authenticity of a manifestation is a question of physical identity. In
            the latter case, no question of authenticity in terms of physical identity applies.

            inputs, ∂ is a transition function from one state to another depending on elements of
            the alphabet Ʃ, q0 is the initial state, and F is the subset of Q that constitute the
            acceptable final states. An automaton succeeds on input X (a string of items of the
            alphabet Ʃ) if the machine transits from the initial state through intermediate states
            up to a final state while receiving input X, and fails if it remains in an intermediate

            string s1 for time t1, and string s2 for time t2, etc. Given a change function c or an

            the document itself also implies that documents are not really accounted for as
            changeable objects, but as "events". Events, though they do take time, don't change.
            This attempt to account for document change has the seemingly paradoxical consequence
            that documents do not really change at all. (A poker may exemplify change by being first
            cold, and then warm. But a poker which is cold at the one end and warm at the other does
            not exemplify change.) </textual><footnote class="po-popup e163 e163"><para class="po-block e164 e164"><textual class="po-textual">The example is taken from [</textual><xref class="po-milestone e165 e165" linkend="simons87"><textual class="po-textual">Ciao Pippo!

            space-time slices proposed by so-called "four-dimensionalism" in ontology, and some of
            the criticisms of that notion. The notion of space-time slices was introduced by
            philosophers like Quine and Goodman in an attempt to salvage the claim that concrete
            physical objects (or more generally, individuals) are identical with the sum of their
            parts (the claim that "the whole is nothing over and above its parts"), yet can undergo
            change. If an object is identical to the sum of its parts, then how can it lose a part,
            and yet remain the same object? One favoured example in the discussion is a cat losing
            its tail. After the loss of its tail, the cat is still the same cat, but clearly not the

            not the sum of its parts at any single moment, but the sum of all its temporal as well
            as its spatial parts. And when the cat is considered as the sum of all its
            spatio-temporal parts, there is no difficulty explaining how references to the cat
            before and after the loss of its tail can be references to the same cat: they refer to
            two spatio-temporal parts of the very same cat. What we have before us at any particular
            moment when we consider the cat is not the whole cat, but a temporal part, a time-slice,
            of the cat.</textual></para><para class="po-block e168 e168"><textual class="po-textual"> One of the critics of this conception, Peter Simons, points out that on the

            Simons' complaint "is not that the four-dimensional ontology is inconsistent (if it is
            inconsistent, this is far from obvious), but that no one has begun to do the work

                    four-dimensionalism are "cheating", i.e. they are relying on the ordinary
                    distinction between continuants and occurents in all their claims that the
                    former can be reduced to the latter. He does not argue that a language where all

                    four-dimensional objects and their spatio-temporal parts is impossible, but that
