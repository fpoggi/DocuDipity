Such discussions also have an inherent assumption of looking at the meaning of a tag at the moment. Employment of XML markup and machine ontologies for long-term digital preservation raises question of how meaning of tags may alter over time and how tags meaning may differ depending on the agent interpreting the tag. This paper discusses the Preserving Virtual Worlds project on the preservation of computer games and the semantic issues that arose in trying to use XML and OWL ontologies for long-term digital preservation.</textual></para></abstract><author class="po-record e9 e9"><personname class="po-record e10 e10"><firstname class="po-field e11 e11"><textual class="po-textual">Jerome</textual></firstname><surname class="po-field e12 e12"><textual class="po-textual">McDonough</textual></surname></personname><personblurb class="po-container e13 e13"><para class="po-block e14 e14"><textual class="po-textual">Jerome McDonough is an associate professor in the Graduate School of Library &amp; Information Science at the University of Illinois.

Essentially, the goal of a preservationist is to allow users of libraries and archives to make sense of the information in a collection, whether their interests are technological, historical or cultural. In the next section, I will discuss the role that XML and OWL played in trying to pursue these goals, and then discuss the implications of this for larger discussions of XML semantics.</textual></para></section><section class="po-hcontainer e95 e95" xml:id="S3"><title class="po-block e96 e96"><textual class="po-textual">Problems in Using XML for Preservation: Trying to Make Sense of Sense-Making</textual></title><para class="po-block e97 e97"><textual class="po-textual">Recognizing the need to incorporate significant amounts of representation information and contextual information about a game as part of a package used to preserve a game in the long term, and recognizing that this in turn meant preserving a great deal of information about the relationships between the digital files we would include in an archival package for a game, the Preserving Virtual Worlds team turned to XML and OWL as mechanisms to tackle this problem in knowledge representation and management.  OWL-DL was used to create an ontology in which the major entities from the FRBR entity-relationship model were defined as OWL classes, and relationships from FRBR were defined as properties.  Relationships between various information entities in the OAIS reference model were further defined as properties in the ontology relating different FRBR classes. A partial representation of the OWL class and property relationships in the Preserving Virtual Worlds ontology is shown in </textual><xref class="po-milestone e98 e98" linkend="figure2"><textual class="po-textual">Ciao Pippo!

Equally unhappy, however, was the realization that the semantic interpretation we had been applying to our "hasRepresentationInformation" term was somewhat at odds with how the OAIS Reference Model describes representation information as a concept.  Our understanding aligned with asking the question of "in the abstract, does Document A have Document B as representation information" and not "in the case of this specific file, does Document A require Document B as representation information." This is clearly problematic at a variety of levels, not the least of which is 'how is a user in 100 years, seeing our ontology applied in a preservation environment, going to know that our interpretation of representation information is at variance with the original standards document which proposed the concept?'</textual></para><para class="po-block e122 e122"><textual class="po-textual">One final problematic arose in applying our ontology in packaging of computer games, with respect to the idea of context information in the OAIS Reference Model.

The problem with this definition with respect to games is that the task of documenting a game's relationship to its environment and identifying how it relates to any and all other content information objects is a nigh-infinite task.

Scholars will interpret the application of a 'hasContextInformation' predicate to information they need for their work as an endorsement of the significance of their field of study; similarly, finding that information they need doesn't receive recognition as context information (and information they consider irrelevant has) will also speak to the significance (or lack thereof) of their work.

Or is it both? Or neither?

What I am arguing for here is an effort to preserve information about our preservation systems that extends well beyond traditional archival notions of provenance. We need a record of not only the specific actions we have taken with a historical object, but documentation of the larger socio-technical systems in which an object has been housed, categorized, discussed, reformatted, linked and disseminated.
